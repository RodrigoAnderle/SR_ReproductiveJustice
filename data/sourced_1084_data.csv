THIS REVIEW APPLIES A REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE FRAMEWORK, TO SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEW THE IMPACT OF RESPIRATORY EPIDEMICS ON SRH, IN ORDER TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON EQUITABLE, SUSTAINED ACCESS TO QUALITY SRH SERVICES FOR ALL POPULATIONS. THIS FRAMEWORK HIGHLIGHTS THE RIGHT TO REPRODUCTIVE AUTONOMY, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO HAVE AN ABORTION, CONCEIVE, BEAR AND RAISE CHILDREN; AND IS INCLUSIVE OF THE INTERSECTIONALITY OF RACE, CLASS AND GENDER. THIS REVIEW INCLUDES ORIGINAL, PEER-REVIEWED RESEARCH RELATED TO COVID-19 AND WOMEN AND GIRLS' SRH THROUGH MAY 31, 2021, AND CONSISTED OF TITLE AND ABSTRACT SCREENING, FULL-TEXT SCREENING, AND DATA ABSTRACTION. OVERALL, TWENTY-FOUR STUDIES MET ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA. RESULTS EMPHASIZE THAT THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC RESULTED IN SERVICE DISRUPTIONS THAT EFFECTED ACCESS TO ABORTION, CONTRACEPTIVES, HIV/STI TESTING, AND CHANGES IN CHANGES IN SEXUAL BEHAVIORS, MENSTRUATION, AND PREGNANCY INTENTIONS. THESE FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT THE URGENT NEED TO ENACT POLICIES THAT ENSURE EQUITABLE, TIMELY ACCESS TO QUALITY SRH SERVICES FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS, DESPITE PANDEMIC RESPONSE POLICIES. THIS REVIEW ALSO HIGHLIGHTS OPPORTUNITIES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW COVID-19 RELATED DISRUPTIONS IN SRH SERVICE PROVISION, ACCESS AND/OR UTILIZATION HAVE IMPACTED UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS AND THOSE WITH INTERSECTIONAL IDENTITIES, WHO FACED SRH INEQUITIES PRIOR TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND THE INDIRECT IMPACT OF COVID-19 AND EPIDEMIC CONTROL MEASURES ON A WIDER RANGE OF SRH OUTCOMES (E.G., MENSTRUAL DISORDERS, FERTILITY SERVICES, GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY) IN THE LONG-TERM.

STUDY DESIGN: THIS QUALITATIVE STUDY INVOLVED INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS WITH 15 CLINICIANS WORKING IN OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY IN SOUTH CAROLINA ABOUT THEIR APPROACHES TO CONTRACEPTIVE COUNSELING. WE ANALYZED THE DATA USING A COMBINATION OF DEDUCTIVE AND INDUCTIVE APPROACHES. RESULTS: CLINICIANS ATTRIBUTED CHALLENGES OF WORKING WITH DIVERSE PATIENT POPULATIONS TO PATIENTS' RACE/ETHNICITY, SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, AND AGE. CLINICIANS OFTEN INTERPRETED PATIENT CONCERNS ABOUT OR REFUSAL TO USE EFFECTIVE CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS AS A PROBLEM WITH PATIENTS THEMSELVES. WHEN CLINICIANS DESCRIBED PATIENTS IN DISPARAGING WAYS, THEY OFTEN FOCUSED ON ADOLESCENT PATIENTS. CONCLUSION: BIAS INFORMED BY STRUCTURAL INEQUALITIES AND POWER RELATIONS INFLUENCES HOW CLINICIANS PERCEIVE THEIR PATIENTS AND APPROACH COUNSELING THEM ABOUT CONTRACEPTION. SUCH PRACTICES MAY LIMIT PATIENTS' INFORMED DECISION-MAKING AND AUTONOMY REGARDING INITIATING OR CONTINUING CONTRACEPTIVE USE. IMPLICATIONS: GREATER ATTENTION TO REDRESSING STRUCTURAL INEQUALITIES AND POWER RELATIONS THAT INFORM PROVIDER BIAS IN THE CONTEXT OF CONTRACEPTIVE COUNSELING IS NEEDED TO ENSURE PATIENTS RECEIVE PERSONCENTERED HEALTHCARE FREE FROM PREJUDICE AND DISCRIMINATION.

PREVIOUS STUDIES SUGGEST THAT RESTRICTING ACCESS TO ABORTION IS A RISK FACTOR FOR ADVERSE MATERNAL AND INFANT HEALTH. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS INVESTIGATION IS TO STUDY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TYPE AND THE NUMBER OF STATE-LEVEL RESTRICTIVE ABORTION LAWS AND INFANT MORTALITY RISK. METHODS: WE USED DATA ON 11,972,629 INFANTS AND MOTHERS FROM THE US COHORT LINKED BIRTH/INFANT DEATH DATA FILES 2008-2010. STATE-LEVEL ABORTION LAWS INCLUDED MEDICAID FUNDING RESTRICTIONS, MANDATORY PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT, MANDATORY COUNSELING, MANDATORY WAITING PERIOD, AND TWO-VISIT LAWS. MULTILEVEL LOGISTIC REGRESSION WAS USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER TYPE OR NUMBER OF STATE-LEVEL RESTRICTIVE ABORTION LAWS DURING YEAR OF BIRTH WERE ASSOCIATED WITH ODDS OF INFANT MORTALITY. RESULTS: COMPARED TO INFANTS LIVING IN STATES WITH NO RESTRICTIVE LAWS, INFANTS LIVING IN STATES WITH ONE OR TWO RESTRICTIVE LAWS (ADJUSTED ODDS RATIO (AOR) = 1.08; 95\% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI] = 0.99-1.18) AND THOSE LIVING IN STATES WITH 3 TO 5 RESTRICTIVE LAWS (AOR = 1.10; 95\% CI = 1.01-1.20) WERE MORE LIKELY TO DIE. SEPARATE ANALYSES EXAMINING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT LAWS AND INFANT MORTALITY RISK, STRATIFIED BY MATERNAL AGE, INDICATED THAT SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATIONS WERE OBSERVED AMONG MOTHERS AGED <= 19 YEARS (AOR = 1.09, 95\% CI = 1.00-1.19), AND 20 TO 25 YEARS (AOR = 1.10, 95\% CI = 1.03-1.17).

RACE IS A SOCIAL CONSTRUCT AND NOT AN INHERENT BIOLOGIC OR GENETIC REALITY; THEREFORE, RACIAL DIFFERENCES IN HEALTH OUTCOMES REPRESENT THE CONSEQUENCES OF STRUCTURAL RACISM OR THE INEQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR HEALTH ALONG RACIALIZED LINES. CLINICIANS AND SCIENTISTS IN OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO WORK TO ELIMINATE HEALTH INEQUITIES FOR BLACK, BROWN, AND INDIGENOUS BIRTHING PEOPLE, AND FULFILLING THIS RESPONSIBILITY REQUIRES ACTIONABLE EVIDENCE FROM HIGH-QUALITY RESEARCH. TO GENERATE THIS ACTIONABLE EVIDENCE, THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY MUST REALIGN PARADIGMS, PRAXIS, AND INFRASTRUCTURE WITH AN EYE DIRECTED TOWARD REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE AND ANTIRACISM. THIS SPECIAL REPORT OFFERS A SET OF KEY RECOMMENDATIONS AS A ROADMAP TO TRANSFORM PERINATAL HEALTH RESEARCH TO ACHIEVE HEALTH EQUITY. THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE BASED ON EXPERT OPINION AND EVIDENCE PRESENTED AT THE STATE OF THE SCIENCE RESEARCH SYMPOSIUM AT THE 41ST ANNUAL PREGNANCY MEETING OF THE SOCIETY FOR MATERNAL-FETAL MEDICINE IN 2021. RECOMMENDATIONS FALL INTO 3 BROAD CATEGORIES-CHANGING RESEARCH PARADIGMS, REFORMING RESEARCH PRAXIS, AND TRANSFORMING RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE-AND ARE GROUNDED IN A HISTORIC FOUNDATION OF THE ADVANCES AND SHORTCOMINGS OF CLINICAL, PUBLIC HEALTH, AND SOCIOLOGIC SCHOLARSHIP IN HEALTH EQUITY. CHANGING THE RESEARCH PARADIGM REQUIRES LEVERAGING A MULTIDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVE ON STRUCTURAL RACISM; PROMOTING MECHANISTIC RESEARCH THAT IDENTIFIES THE BIOLOGIC PATHWAYS PERTURBED BY STRUCTURAL RACISM; AND UTILIZING CONCEPTUAL MODELS THAT ACCOUNT FOR RACISM AS A FACTOR IN ADVERSE PERINATAL OUTCOMES. CHANGING PRAXIS APPROACHES TO PROMOTE AND ENGAGE MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAMS AND TO DEVELOP STANDARDIZED GUIDELINES FOR DATA COLLECTION WILL ENSURE THAT PARADIGM SHIFTS CENTER THE HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED VOICES OF BLACK, BROWN, AND INDIGENOUS BIRTHING PEOPLE. FINALLY, INFRASTRUCTURE CHANGES THAT EMBED COMMUNITY-CENTERED APPROACHES ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE SHIFTS IN PARADIGM AND PRAXIS POSSIBLE. INSTITUTIONAL POLICIES THAT BREAK DOWN SILOS AND SUPPORT TRUE COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP, AND ALSO THE ALIGNMENT OF INSTITUTIONAL, FUNDING, AND ACADEMIC PUBLISHING OBJECTIVES WITH STRATEGIC PRIORITIES FOR PERINATAL HEALTH EQUITY, ARE PARAMOUNT. ACHIEVING HEALTH EQUITY REQUIRES SHIFTING THE STRUCTURES THAT SUPPORT THE ECOSYSTEM OF RACISM THAT BLACK, BROWN, AND INDIGENOUS BIRTHING PEOPLE MUST NAVIGATE BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER CHILDBEARING. THESE STRUCTURES EXTEND BEYOND THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN WHICH CLINICIANS OPERATE DAY-TO-DAY, BUT THEY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED FROM RESEARCH ENDEAVORS TO CREATE THE ACTIONABLE EVIDENCE NEEDED TO ACHIEVE PERINATAL HEALTH EQUITY.";"10.1016/j.ajog.2022.05.033";"ARTICLE"

COMBINED, THESE ASSESSMENTS DOWNPLAY SIDE EFFECTS (I.E., MEDICAL RISKS), SUGGESTING THAT LARC AND OTHER PHARMA-CONTRACEPTIVES ARE WORTH THE RISK TO PROTECT CISGENDER WOMEN FROM THEIR FERTILE BODIES AND TO GUARD SOCIETY AGAINST UNINTENDED PREGNANCY. THROUGH THIS PROCESS, RANKING BIRTH CONTROL METHODS BY FAILURE RATES RATHER THAN BY SIDE EFFECTS OR REPRODUCTIVE AUTONOMY BECOMES LOGICAL AS EFFICACY IS EQUATED WITH SAFETY FOR CISGENDER WOMEN AND SOCIETY.

THIS PROJECT AIMED TO IDENTIFY CORE COMPETENCIES TO GUIDE SRH TRAINING ACROSS THE PRIMARY CARE PROFESSIONS. STUDY DESIGN: A SIX-MEMBER INTERPROFESSIONAL EXPERT WORKING GROUP DRAFTED SRH COMPETENCIES FOR PRIMARY CARE TEAM MEMBERS. PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS INCLUDING FAMILY PHYSICIANS, NURSES, NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND CERTIFIED NURSE MIDWIVES, PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS AND PHARMACISTS WERE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN A THREE-ROUND ELECTRONIC DELPHI SURVEY. IN EACH ROUND, PARTICIPANTS VOTED BY EMAIL TO RETAIN, ELIMINATE OR REVISE EACH COMPETENCY, WITH THEIR SUGGESTED EDITS TO THE COMPETENCIES INCORPORATED BY THE RESEARCHERS AFTER EACH ROUND. RESULTS: FIFTY PROVIDERS FROM SIX PROFESSIONS PARTICIPATED. IN ROUND 1, 17 OF 33 DRAFT COMPETENCIES REACHED THE 75\% PREDETERMINED AGREEMENT LEVEL TO BE ACCEPTED AS WRITTEN. FIVE WERE COMBINED, REDUCING THE TOTAL NUMBER TO 28. BASED ON ROUND 2 FEEDBACK, 21 COMPETENCIES WERE REWORDED, AND 2 WERE COMBINED.

THE GREATEST OF THESE IS THE MYTH OF A DEFAULT HUMAN THAT CAN SERVE AS A STANDARD FOR THE REST OF THE POPULATION. THIS RACIST IDEAL UNDERPINS EDUCATION, PROVISION OF CARE, RESEARCH, POLICIES, AND PUBLIC HEALTH PRAXIS. DEMOLISHING THE MYTH STARTS WITH ACKNOWLEDGING THAT BLACK PEOPLE ARE NOT THE ARCHITECTS OF THEIR OWN DESTRUCTION: THE DEFAULT STANDARD OF WHITENESS IS. THE ARTICLE BEGINS WITH A HISTORICAL BACKGROUND ON HOW THIS MYTH CAME TO BE AND ELUCIDATES THE DEVELOPMENT AND PERPETUATIONS OF THE MYTH OF THE DEFAULT HUMAN. NEXT, WE PRESENT AN EVIDENCE BASED SCOPING REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE TO SUMMARIZE CURRENT THINKING WITH SPECIFIC FOCUS ON THE BLACK MATERNAL HEALTH CRISIS, WE MAKE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS AND RETROFITS OF UPSTREAM PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACHES FOR EXISTING PROGRAMS TOWARD HEALTH EQUITY. WE ALSO SITUATE BLACK MATERNAL HEALTH AS PART OF A REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE FRAME THAT CENTERS BLACK WOMEN AND BIRTHING PEOPLE'S AUTONOMY AND AGENCY. IN OTHER WORDS, WE USE THE SCOPING REVIEW TO END WITH REIMAGINING PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY AND PROVIDE AN ACTIONABLE ROADMAP TO SPECIFICALLY DISRUPT THE MYTH OF THE DEFAULT HUMAN AND DISMANTLE RACISM IN EDUCATION, PROVISION OF CARE, RESEARCH, POLICIES, AND PUBLIC HEALTH PRAXIS.";"10.3389/fpubh.2021.675788";"REVIEW"

BACKGROUND: OVERDOSE RELATED MATERNAL MORTALITY, OFTEN INVOLVING OPIOIDS, IS A NATIONAL GROWING PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN. OUD IS A HIGHLY STIGMATIZED CONDITION THAT MAY NEGATIVELY INFLUENCE THE WELL-BEING OF PREGNANT/PARENTING INDIVIDUAL'S REPRODUCTIVE AND HUMAN RIGHTS. STUDY DESIGN: SECONDARY QUALITATIVE DATA ANALYSIS. METHODS: A SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED USING INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS (N=23) FROM A LARGER STUDY AIMED AT EXAMINING CONTEXTUAL FACTORS SURROUNDING PREGNANT/PARENTING INDIVIDUAL'S EXPERIENCES WITH OPIOID USE RETURN TO USE AND/OR OVERDOSE. THE RJ FRAMEWORK WAS USED AS A FRAMEWORK TO EXAMINE THE INFLUENCE OF OUD-RELATED STIGMA AND A PERSON'S RIGHT TO BODILY AUTONOMY, THEIR RIGHT TO PARENT, AND THEIR RIGHT TO PARENT THE CHILDREN THEY HAVE IN SAFE AND SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENTS.

WE TAKE UP THIS OVERSIGHT IN RELATION TO THE 2016 U.S. SUPREME COURT DECISION IN WHOLE WOMAN'S HEALTH V. HELLERSTEDT, WHICH ADJUDICATED THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF A TEXAS LAW THAT IMPOSED NEW REGULATIONS ON ABORTION PROVIDERS. BECAUSE HALF OF THE STATE'S ABORTION PROVIDERS WERE UNABLE TO MEET THESE REGULATIONS AND THUS CLOSED, THE DISTANCE THAT MANY TEXAS WOMEN HAD TO TRAVEL FOR ABORTION SERVICES INCREASED DRAMATICALLY. IN PART BECAUSE OF THESE INCREASES, THE SUPREME COURT ULTIMATELY DETERMINED THAT THE TEXAS LAWS IMPOSED AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL ``UNDUE BURDEN.'' BRINGING TOGETHER CASE LAW AND ETHNOGRAPHIC DATA, THIS ARTICLE TRACES THE PROCESS BY WHICH DISTANCE IS MADE LEGALLY ``LEGIBLE'' IN THE CONTEXT OF REPRODUCTIVE INJUSTICE. IN SO DOING, IT CONFRONTS MORE UNEASY REALITIES OF DISTANCE, INCLUDING THE DISCURSIVE DISMISSAL OF SOCIAL AND LITERAL IMMOBILITY AND ISOLATION; CONTRADICTORY READINGS OF ``EMPTINESS''; AND THE MATERIAL SPATIALITY OF DISTANCE THROUGH THE NONPLACE-NESS OF RURAL AREAS. TOGETHER, THESE FACTORS ILLUMINATE A MORE SIGNIFICANT DISTANCE, NAMELY THE EPISTEMIC AND SOCIAL DISTANCE THAT EXISTS BETWEEN THE LEGAL PERFORMANCE OF DISTANCE IN LITIGATION AND THE EMBODIED TRAVERSAL OF DISTANCE BY A WOMAN SEEKING AN ABORTION IN TEXAS. PRIORITIZING RURAL DISTANCE AS MATERIAL, LEGAL AND GENDERED, OUR WORK ENGAGES AND AUGMENTS THE NASCENT FIELD OF FEMINIST LEGAL GEOGRAPHIES.

HISTORICAL DATA FROM THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY DEMONSTRATE THAT THE REMOVAL OF SAFE ABORTION OPTIONS WILL INCREASE COMPLICATIONS AND THE HEALTH RISKS TO PREGNANT PATIENTS. BECAUSE THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT IS A CRITICAL ACCESS POINT FOR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE, EMERGENCY CLINICIANS MUST BE PREPARED FOR THE POLICY, CLINICAL, EDUCATIONAL, AND LEGAL IMPLICATIONS OF THIS CHANGE. THE GOAL OF THIS PAPER, THEREFORE, IS TO DESCRIBE THE IMPACT OF THE REVERSAL OF ROE V.

REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE IS DEFINED AS THE COMPLETE WELL-BEING OF WOMEN AND GIRLS, BASED ON THEIR HUMAN RIGHT TO DECIDE WHEN AND HOW TO HAVE - OR NOT HAVE - CHILDREN, AND TO PARENT EXISTING CHILDREN IN SAFE AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES. THE CONDITIONS OF ENSLAVEMENT IN HAITI WERE PARTICULARLY DETRIMENTAL TO WOMEN'S CONTROL OVER THEIR FERTILITY AND OVERALL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AS BIRTH RATES REMAINED SO LOW THAT THE ENSLAVED POPULATION COULD NOT REPRODUCE ITSELF; HOWEVER, FINDINGS FROM AN UNDERUTILIZED ARCHIVAL ROSTER CONTAINING DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION ON THE ONLY FORMALLY RECOGNIZED COMMUNITY OF MAROONS FROM COLONIAL HAITI, THE MANIEL, INDICATE THAT THE CHILD-WOMAN RATIO AMONG FUGITIVE WOMEN WAS OVER TWICE AS HIGH AS THEIR COUNTERPARTS WHO REMAINED ENSLAVED ON PLANTATIONS. SUBVERSIVE READING OF RUNAWAY SLAVE ADVERTISEMENTS ALSO SUGGESTS THAT CHOOSING TO ABSCOND WAS A RARE BUT EFFECTIVE MECHANISM FOR WOMEN TO ACHIEVE REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE BY EXERCISING AGENCY OVER THEIR LIVES AND PROTECTING THEIR CHILDBEARING CAPABILITIES. BY HIGHLIGHTING MOTHERHOOD DURING A STATE OF FUGITIVITY IN ONE OF THE MOST ECONOMICALLY PROSPEROUS SLAVE SOCIETIES IN MODERN HISTORY, THIS PAPER CAN HELP ESTABLISH HISTORICAL PRECEDENT FOR CONTEMPORARY REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE CLAIMS.

IT ARGUES THAT RATHER THAN MEETING THE NEEDS AND DEMANDS OF THESE WOMEN FOR ACCESS TO SAFE CONTRACEPTION THAT THEY CAN CONTROL, THE INDIAN STATE HAS TARGETED THEM FOR COERCIVE MASS STERILISATIONS AND UNSAFE INJECTABLE CONTRACEPTIVES. THIS IS MADE POSSIBLE BY THE LONG-TERM CONSTRUCTION OF PARTICULAR WOMEN'S LIVES AS DEVALUED AND DISPOSABLE, AND OF THEIR BODIES AS EXCESSIVELY FERTILE AND THEREFORE INIMICAL TO DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRESS.

IN PARTICULAR, IT ARGUES THAT THE VIOLENCE OF POPULATION POLICIES IS BEING DEEPENED AS A RESULT OF THREE CENTRAL AND INTERRELATED ASPECTS OF THIS FRAMEWORK: CORPORATE DISPOSSESSION AND DISPLACEMENT, THE INTENSIFICATION AND EXTENSION OF WOMEN'S LABOUR FOR GLOBAL CAPITAL, AND THE DISCOURSES AND EMBODIED PRACTICES OF FAR-RIGHT HINDU SUPREMACISM.

A MOTHER OR BIRTHING PERSON'S MENTAL HEALTH BEFORE AND DURING PREGNANCY AND THE POSTPARTUM PERIOD IS ESSENTIAL FOR A CHILD'S DEVELOPMENT. DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF LIFE, INFANTS REQUIRE EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT AND BONDING TO STRIVE. PERINATAL MOOD DISORDERS ARE LIKELY TO HINDER ATTACHMENT AND ARE ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED RISK OF ADVERSE MENTAL HEALTH EFFECTS FOR CHILDREN LATER IN LIFE. THE BLACK COMMUNITY IS FACED WITH A CRISIS AS BLACK MOTHERS EXPERIENCE A HIGHER PREVALENCE OF PERINATAL MOOD DISORDERS, INCLUDING POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, COMPARED TO THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL ESTIMATES. THE AIM OF THE RESEARCH IS TO IDENTIFY SOCIAL, STRUCTURAL, AND ECONOMIC DISPARITIES OF BLACK PERINATAL WOMEN AND BIRTHING PEOPLE'S EXPERIENCE TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF PERINATAL MENTAL HEALTH ON INFANTS' MENTAL HEALTH. BLACK MOTHERS AND BIRTHING PEOPLE MAY OFTEN FACE SOCIAL AND STRUCTURAL BARRIERS THAT LIMIT THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK AND ENGAGE WITH INTERVENTIONS AND TREATMENT THAT ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSES OF THEIR PERINATAL MOOD DISORDER.

AFTER DESCRIBING AND EVALUATING BRITISH REGULATORY MEASURES, I CONSIDER SUCCESSIVE FAILURES TO CONTROL THE ASSISTED REPRODUCTION INDUSTRY IN THE US. I DISCUSS DISPARITIES BETWEEN UK AND US REGULATORY INITIATIVES AND THEIR BEARING ON REGULATION IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THEN I TURN TO THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL STRUCTURES IN WHICH THE ASSISTED REPRODUCTION INDUSTRY IS EMBEDDED. I ARGUE THAT REGULATORY BODIES ARE SELDOM NEUTRAL ARBITERS. THEY TEND TO RESPOND MOST READILY TO SPECIAL INTERESTS AND NEGLECT STRATEGIES THAT COULD MORE EFFECTIVELY MEET THE HEALTH NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE THEY REPRESENT. NEITHER NATIONAL NOR INTERNATIONAL BODIES HAVE AGGRESSIVELY PURSUED POLICIES TO HARNESS THE INDUSTRY, REDUCE INFERTILITY RATES, OR MEET THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WHOSE FERTILITY IS THREATENED BY SUBSTANDARD HEALTHCARE AND ENVIRONMENTAL NEGLECT.

DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SETTING PRIMARY DATA WERE COLLECTED VIA A NATIONAL ONLINE SURVEY AMONG PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THE UNITED STATES INTERESTED IN PURSUING MIDWIFERY EDUCATION AND CAREERS BETWEEN FEBRUARY 22 AND MAY 2, 2021. STUDY DESIGN CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY CONSISTED OF 76 QUESTIONS (75 CLOSED-ENDED AND 1 OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS) INCLUDING PERSONAL, FAMILIAL, COMMUNITY, AND SOCIETAL MOTIVATORS AND BARRIERS TO PURSUING MIDWIFERY. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS WE RECRUITED RESPONDENTS 18 YEARS AND OLDER WHO IDENTIFIED AS PERSONS OF COLOR BY POSTING THE SURVEY LINK ON MIDWIFERY, CHILDBIRTH, AND REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE LISTSERVS, SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS, AND THROUGH EMAILS TO RELEVANT MIDWIFERY AND DOULA NETWORKS. WE CONDUCTED DESCRIPTIVE AND BIVARIATE ANALYSES BY DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS AND USED EXEMPLAR QUOTES FROM THE OPEN-ENDED QUESTION TO ILLUSTRATE FINDINGS FROM THE DESCRIPTIVE DATA. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS THE STRONGEST MOTIVATING FACTORS FOR THE 799 RESPONDENTS WERE PROVIDING RACIALLY CONCORDANT CARE FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS (87.7 PERCENT), REDUCING RACIAL DISPARITIES IN HEALTH (67.2 PERCENT), AND PERSONAL EXPERIENCES RELATED TO MIDWIFERY CARE (55.4 PERCENT) AND HEALTH CARE MORE BROADLY (54.6 PERCENT). MAIN BARRIERS TO ENTERING MIDWIFERY WERE DIRECT (58.2 PERCENT) AND RELATED (27.5 TO 52.8 PERCENT) COSTS OF MIDWIFERY EDUCATION, AND LACK OF RACIAL CONCORDANCE IN MIDWIFERY EDUCATION AND THE MIDWIFERY PROFESSION (31.5 PERCENT) THAT MAY CONTRIBUTE TO RACIALLY MOTIVATED EXCLUSION OF PEOPLE OF COLOR. FINANCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL BARRIERS WERE STRONGEST AMONG THOSE WITH LOWER LEVELS OF INCOME OR EDUCATION.

THE CONCEPT OF REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE HAS BEEN EMPLOYED IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES FOR ALMOST 30 YEARS, YET NURSING HAS BEEN SLOW TO ADOPT THIS CONCEPT IN PROMOTING MATERNAL-CHILD HEALTH. OBJECTIVE TO ANALYZE THE CONCEPT OF REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE AS USED IN PEER-REVIEWED PUBLICATIONS WITH THE AIM OF REFRAMING BLACK MATERNAL HEALTH IN PUBLIC HEALTH NURSING SCHOLARSHIP, RESEARCH, PRACTICE, AND ADVOCACY. DESIGN WE CONDUCTED A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCE LITERATURE. WE ANALYZED SELECTED ARTICLES THOUGH A PRINCIPLE-BASED CONCEPT ANALYSIS FOCUSING ON EPISTEMOLOGICAL, PRAGMATIC, LINGUISTIC, AND LOGICAL PRINCIPLES. SAMPLE EIGHT ARTICLES WERE SELECTED FROM A POOL OF 377. RESULTS RACE WAS IDENTIFIED AS A SOURCE OF POWER FOR UNDERSTANDING REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE THROUGH INDIVIDUAL KNOWLEDGE, COLLECTIVE KNOWLEDGE, AND PRAXIS. PRAGMATICALLY, REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE IS A SOCIAL JUSTICE-ORIENTED PLATFORM THAT BRIDGES THE PRO-CHOICE/PRO-LIFE DIVIDE; AIDS COALITION BUILDING; AND PROMOTES INCLUSION. LINGUISTICALLY, THE CONCEPT IS DISTINCT FROM BOTH REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE IS LOGICALLY SITUATED WITHIN INTERSECTIONALITY THEORY AND THE CUMULATIVE EMBODIMENT OF OPPRESSIONS BLACK WOMEN EXPERIENCE BASED ON RACE, CLASS, AND GENDER. CONCLUSION REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE REFRAMES PUBLIC HEALTH NURSING ACTIONS FOR BLACK WOMEN BY FOCUSING ON UNCOVERING SYSTEMS OF OPPRESSION, RECOGNIZING PAST HISTORICAL INJUSTICES, AND ADVANCING CULTURAL SAFETY IN HEALTH PROMOTION.

THE ARTICLE PROPOSES THREE INTERRELATED AREAS IN WHICH EMOTION SHAPES FEMINIST COALITIONS: (1) FEELINGS TOWARDS COALITION PARTNERS: FEELINGS OF MISTRUST, ANGER, FEAR, OR THEIR REVERSE GROW FROM HISTORIES OF INTERACTION AND UNEQUAL POWER. THESE MAKE UP THE EMOTIONAL LANDSCAPE OF INTERSECTIONAL COALITIONS, WHICH OPERATE THROUGH A TENSION BETWEEN NEGATIVE EMOTIONS AND ATTEMPTS AT EMPATHY OR MUTUAL ACCEPTANCE; (2) SHARED FEELINGS: FEMINIST COALITIONS BUILD ON SHARED FEAR OF THREAT OR ANGER AT A COMMON ENEMY; AND (3) EMERGENT EMOTIONS IN COLLECTIVE ACTION. COALITION PARTNERS POSSESS DISTINCT EMOTION CULTURES. JOINT COLLECTIVE ACTION CAN CEMENT BONDS WHEN ALL PARTICIPANTS' EMOTION CULTURES ARE REFLECTED, OR WEAKEN COALITIONS WHEN THE REVERSE IS TRUE. IN ALL THREE OF THESE AREAS, ORGANIZERS ENGAGE IN EMOTIONAL LABOUR IN ORDER TO CREATE OR MAINTAIN COALITIONS.

THE IMPACT OF THESE LAWS ON MATERNAL AND CHILD POPULATION HEALTH OUTCOMES AND INEQUITIES IS UNKNOWN. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER STATES THAT IMPLEMENT GESTATIONAL AGE LIMIT LAWS EXPERIENCE SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN RATES OF INFANT MORTALITY. METHODS: USING U.S. POPULATION.BASED DATA FROM THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR HEALTH STATISTICS LINKED INFANT BIRTH-DEATH FILES (2005-2017), DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCES MODELS WERE ESTIMATED USING MULTIVARIABLE LINEAR REGRESSIONS TO COMPARE THE TRENDS IN INFANT MORTALITY (ALL-CAUSE AND CAUSE-SPECIFIC RATES) IN STATES WITH GESTATIONAL AGE LIMIT LAWS WITH THE TRENDS IN STATES WITHOUT SUCH LAWS. MODELS STRATIFIED BY MATERNAL RACIAL/ETHNIC GROUP EXPLORED RACIAL HETEROGENEITY IN THE LAW'S IMPACT. DATA WERE ANALYZED IN 2020. RESULTS: THIS STUDY INCLUDED 16,232,133 BIRTHS IN STATES THAT ENACTED A GESTATION AGE LIMIT ABORTION LAW AND 36,472,309 BIRTHS IN STATES THAT DID NOT FROM 2005 TO 2017. IN DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCE ANALYSES, GESTATIONAL AGE LIMIT LAWS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH 0.23 EXCESS INFANT DEATHS PER 1,000 LIVE BIRTHS (95\% CI=0.09, 0.37, P<0.01). IN CAUSE-SPECIFIC ANALYSES, GESTATIONAL AGE LIMIT LAWS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH 0.10 ADDITIONAL INFANT DEATHS OWING TO CONGENITAL ANOMALIES PER 1,000 LIVE BIRTHS (95\% CI=0.03, 0.17, P=0.01). ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN GESTATIONAL AGE LIMIT LAWS AND INFANT MORTALITY IN MODELS STRATIFIED BY MATERNAL RACIAL/ETHNIC GROUP WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT.

THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE COLLECTIVE ACTION FRAMES (CAFS) OF ADVOCATES AT THE EJ/RJ NEXUS. CAFS HIGHLIGHT HOW ADVOCATES IDENTIFY PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS, AND MOTIVATE ACTION. THE USE OF INTERSECTIONALITY WAS IDENTIFIED AS A MAIN CAF USED IN THREE KEY WAYS: BREAKING FREE FROM IDENTITY-BASED, ISSUE-BASED, AND MOVEMENT-BASED SILOES. FIRST, INTERVIEWEES DESCRIBED BREAKING FREE FROM IDENTITY-BASED SILOES BY IDENTIFYING RISKS OF TOXIC EXPOSURES THAT RESULT FROM INTERSECTING SOCIAL LOCATIONS (E.G. GENDER, RACE/ETHNICITY, INCOME, IMMIGRATION STATUS) AND BY EQUALLY PRIORITIZING MULTIPLE ASPECTS OF THEIR IDENTITIES AS THEY ENGAGE IN ADVOCACY. SECOND, THEY DESCRIBED BREAKING FREE FROM ISSUE-BASED SILOES BY DEVELOPING MULTI-ISSUE AGENDAS THAT ADDRESS A COMPLEX WEB OF INTERRELATED PROBLEMS IMPACTING HEALTH. THIRD, THEY DESCRIBED BREAKING FREE FROM MOVEMENT-BASED SILOES BY DEVELOPING CROSS-MOVEMENT COLLABORATIONS TO ADDRESS ISSUES OF MUTUAL CONCERN. AMONG MULTIPLE REASONS GIVEN FOR CROSS-MOVEMENT COLLABORATIONS, ADVOCATES PERCEIVED THEM AS VALUABLE IN ORDER TO DISRUPT SOCIAL, POLITICAL, AND ECONOMIC POWER IMBALANCES THAT SHAPE ENVIRONMENTAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH INEQUITIES, AS WELL AS OTHER HEALTH AND SOCIAL INEQUITIES. BASED ON THESE FINDINGS, WE SUGGEST THAT INTERSECTIONALITY IS A MASTER FRAME, AND THUS MAY BE USEFUL TO ADVOCATES IN OTHER SOCIAL MOVEMENTS ADDRESSING INTERSECTIONAL ISSUES. UNDERSTANDING AN INTERSECTIONALITY FRAME CAN HELP TO INFORM ADVOCACY APPROACHES TO PROMOTE HEALTH AND HEALTH EQUITY, PARTICULARLY THOSE FOCUSED ON POLICIES AND STRUCTURAL DRIVERS OF HEALTH.";"10.1080/14742837.2018.1556091";"ARTICLE"

THIS PAPER USES A TRANSNATIONAL FEMINIST METHODOLOGY TO APPLY THE REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE FRAMEWORK TO THE SITUATION OF MIGRANT WOMEN IN GREAT BRITAIN. THE REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE FRAMEWORK ORIGINATED IN THE ACTIVISM OF MARGINALISED WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES, WHO ARGUED THAT THE MAINSTREAM PROCHOICE MOVEMENT, WITH ITS FOCUS ON ELIMINATING LEGAL AND BUREAUCRATIC OBSTACLES TO ABORTION, FAILED TO ADDRESS THEIR EXPERIENCES AND CONCERNS.

WHEN VIEWED THROUGH THE LENS OF REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE, DISCOURSES OF NATIONAL IDENTITY AND BELONGING UNDERMINE REPRODUCTIVE AUTONOMY BY CONSTRUCTING SOME WOMEN AND THEIR CHILDREN AS VALUED MEMBERS OF THE NATION WHILE OTHERS ARE CONSTRUCTED AS THREATENING OUTSIDERS. THE CONSTRUCTION OF BRITISH IDENTITY AS WHITE HAS RESULTED IN ETHNIC MINORITY IMMIGRANT WOMEN AND THEIR CHILDREN BEING DEPICTED IN BOTH POLICY AND POPULAR DISCOURSE AS `PERPETUAL OUTSIDERS' WHO UNDERMINE `SOCIAL COHESION', AND POSE A CULTURAL THREAT TO THE NATION. SIMILARLY, MOST MIGRANTS ARE TREATED IN BOTH GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA AS AN ECONOMIC BURDEN. CONSEQUENTLY, MIGRANT WOMEN, PARTICULARLY ETHNIC MINORITY IMMIGRANTS, LOW-INCOME IMMIGRANTS, AND THOSE OF UNCERTAIN STATUS, MUST MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT REPRODUCTION IN A VERY HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT, WHERE GOVERNMENT POLICIES MAY RESTRICT THEIR ACCESS TO NECESSARY RESOURCES.

THE BATTLE TO MAKE ABORTION ILLEGAL HAS BEEN PREDICATED ON THREE NEBULOUS ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT HOW ABORTION BANS WORK. FIRST, SUPPORTERS BELIEVE BANNING ABORTION WILL DETER IT. SECOND, THEY HOPE BANS WILL SEND A MESSAGE ABOUT ABORTION-SPECIFICALLY, THAT ABORTION IS IMMORAL. AND THIRD, THEY EXPECT BANS TO BE COMPETENTLY IMPLEMENTED AND ENFORCED. DRAWING ON EMPIRICAL WORK FROM WITHIN AND OUTSIDE OF THE U.S., THIS ARTICLE OFFERS AN EVIDENCE-BASED ASSESSMENT OF EACH OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS. PART ONE EXAMINES THE QUESTION OF DETERRENCE BY EXPLORING FINDINGS FROM COUNTRIES WITH RELATIVELY HIGH AND RELATIVELY LOW ABORTION RATES. AFTER EXPLAINING WHY RESTRICTIVE ABORTION LAWS ALONE DO NOT REDUCE AGGREGATE ABORTION RATES, I CONSIDER THE MATTER OF INDIVIDUAL DETERRENCE. BY IDENTIFYING THOSE MOST LIKELY TO BE DETERRED BY U.S. ABORTION BANS, I ILLUSTRATE HOW ABORTION BANS INTERSECT WITH STRUCTURAL INEQUALITIES TO DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT POOR WOMEN OF COLOR AND THEIR CHILDREN.

WHILE THE OUTCOMES OF AMA PREGNANCIES HAVE BEEN EXAMINED EXTENSIVELY, THE DRIVERS BEHIND INCREASING RATES OF AMA PREGNANCIES IN THE UNITED STATES ARE LESS UNDERSTOOD. SOME SCHOLARS HAVE ASSERTED THAT WOMEN ARE INCREASINGLY DELAYING THEIR FIRST BIRTH IN FAVOR OF EDUCATIONAL AND CAREER ASPIRATIONS. YET BIRTH TRENDS IN THE UNITED STATES DO NOT SUPPORT THIS AS THE PRIMARY EXPLANATORY FACTOR OF AMA BIRTHS. OTHER FACTORS MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO HIGH RATES OF AMA IN THE UNITED STATES. THIS STUDY SOUGHT TO IDENTIFY MAIN PREDICTORS OF AMA BIRTH USING A CROSS-SECTIONAL RETROSPECTIVE SAMPLE. DESIGN: WE EMPLOYED A MULTIVARIATE LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS ON A CROSS-SECTIONAL RETROSPECTIVE SAMPLE TO IDENTIFY SIGNIFICANT INDEPENDENT PREDICTORS OF GIVING BIRTH AT ADVANCE MATERNAL AGE (AMA) IN THE UNITED STATES. SETTING: DATA WAS OBTAINED FROM THE UNITES STATES PREGNANCY RISK ASSESSMENT MONITORING SYSTEM (PRAMS) PHASE 7 CORE QUESTIONNAIRE AND LINKED BIRTH CERTIFICATES. QUESTIONS ARE DESIGNED TO ASSESS MATERNAL ATTITUDES AND EXPERIENCES BEFORE, DURING AND JUST AFTER PREGNANCY. SURVEYS FOR PHASE 7 WERE COMPLETED IN 2017 AND 2018. THE STUDY POPULATION REPRESENTS MOTHERS FROM 34 STATES THAT MET THE CDC'S 55\% RESPONSE RATE THRESHOLD AND PUERTO RICO. PARTICIPANTS: THE PRAMS DATASET COMPRISES SELF-REPORTED DATA AND LINKED BIRTH CERTIFICATE DATA FROM WOMEN WHO RECENTLY GAVE BIRTH. A TOTAL OF 38,549 MOTHERS ARE INCLUDED IN THE PHASE 7 DATASET. STATE SAMPLE SIZES RANGED FROM 503 MOTHERS IN WYOMING TO 1,897 MOTHERS IN MICHIGAN. ALL MOTHERS GAVE BIRTH IN THE YEAR 2017. MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS: THE OUTCOME OF INTEREST WAS AMA BIRTH, DEFINED AS CONCEIVING AND SUBSEQUENTLY GIVING BIRTH TO A BABY AT AGE 35 OR OLDER. PREDICTORS FOR AMA BIRTH WERE SELECTED A PRIORI AND INCLUDED: PREGNANCY INTENTION, HISTORY OF PREVIOUS LIVE BIRTH, INSURANCE STATUS, INCOME, EDUCATION, RACE/ETHNICITY, MARITAL STATUS, AND URBAN LOCATION. PREVIOUS LIVE BIRTH TO AT LEAST ONE CHILD WAS A SIGNIFICANT INDEPENDENT PREDICTOR FOR AMA BIRTH. MOTHERS WITH HIGH PARITY, DEFINED AS 6 OR MORE PREVIOUS LIVE BIRTHS, WERE 17 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO GIVE BIRTH AT ADVANCED MATERNAL AGE. MOTHERS WITH AN UNWANTED PREGNANCY WERE 1.9 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO HAVE AN AMA BIRTH. COLLEGE ATTAINMENT, HIGH INCOME, MARITAL STATUS, URBANICITY, AND RACE/ETHNICITY WERE ALSO INDEPENDENT PREDICTORS OF AMA BIRTH. HEALTH INSURANCE WAS NOT A SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR OF AMA BIRTH AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR OTHER FACTORS. KEY CONCLUSIONS: DELAYED AND LATE CHILDBIRTH MAY NOT BE INTENTIONAL FOR A SIGNIFICANT GROUP OF OLDER MOTHERS. CONVERSE TO POPULAR ASSUMPTIONS THAT WOMEN DELAY CHILDBEARING IN FAVOR OF CAREER ASPIRATIONS, THE MAJORITY OF AMA MOTHERS HAVE PREVIOUS CHILDREN. HALF OF AMA MOTHERS HAVE TWO OR MORE PREVIOUS CHILDREN. THE FINDINGS IN THIS PAPER SUGGESTS THAT MULTIPLE FACTORS PREDICT AMA BIRTHS. THERE MAY BE SEVERAL SUBTYPES OF WOMEN WHO ENTER PREGNANCY AT ADVANCED MATERNAL AGE. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: AS WOMEN WEIGH PERSONAL DESIRE TO BEAR CHILDREN AGAINST COMPETING SOCIAL EXPECTATIONS, THEY MAY FIND THEMSELVES NAVIGATING THEIR OWN UNIQUE PATH SHAPED IN PART BY THE REGION IN WHICH THEY LIVE. BETTER CHARACTERIZATION OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LEAD TO ADVANCED MATERNAL AGE IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING EXPLORATION OF UNINTENDED AND UNWANTED AMA PREGNANCY, IS NECESSARY TO DEVELOP POLICIES AND INTERVENTIONS THAT MEET WOMEN'S NEEDS.

BACKGROUND: MOTHERHOOD AMONG ROMA GIRLS (RGM) IN EUROPE IMPOVERISHES THEIR LIVES, PUTS THEM AT RISK OF POOR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH AND PRECIPITATES SCHOOL DROPOUTS. OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE AFFIRMS THAT THE CONDITIONS OF POVERTY AND THE SOCIAL EXCLUSIONARY PROCESSES THEY SUFFER HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT EXPLANATORY WEIGHT IN THEIR SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE DECISIONS. METHODS: THROUGH A COMMUNITY-BASED PARTICIPATORY ACTION RESEARCH DESIGN, 20-25 ROMA GIRLS WILL BE RECRUITED IN EACH ONE OF THE FOUR IMPOVERISHED COMMUNITIES IN BULGARIA, ROMANIA AND SPAIN. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: DESK REVIEW ABOUT SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCES AND POLICIES WILL BE CARRIED OUT TO FRAME THE PROBLEM. NARRATIVES OF ROMA WOMEN AS WELL AS BASELINE AND END LINE INTERVIEWS OF GIRL PARTICIPANTS WILL BE COLLECTED THROUGH BOTH QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE TECHNIQUES. QUANTITATIVE DATA WILL BE GATHERED THROUGH RELIABLE SCALES OF MATTERING, SOCIO-POLITICAL AGENCY, SATISFACTION WITH LIFE AND SELF. A NARRATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE QUALITATIVE INFORMATION GENERATED IN THE INTERVIEWS WILL BE CARRIED OUT. EXPECTED RESULTS: (1) UNCOVER CONTEXTUAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL PATTERNS OF GIRL-MOTHERHOOD AMONG ROMA WOMEN; (2) BUILD CRITICAL THINKING AMONG ROMA GIRLS TO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN ALL DECISIONS AFFECTING THEM AND ADVOCATE FOR THEIR OWN GENDER RIGHTS WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES; AND (3) EMPOWER ROMA GIRLS AND THEIR SIGNIFICANT ADULTS TO CRITICALLY EVALUATE THEIR OWN INITIATIVES AND PROVIDE FEEDBACK TO THEIR RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS.

SITUATING MOTHERS' EVERYDAY CARE-WORK ALONGSIDE ACTIVISTS' CRITIQUES OF PRIVATIZATION, THE PAPER ADVANCES A MULTI-SCALAR ANALYSIS OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE THAT CONNECTS THE INTIMATE, EMBODIED SPHERE OF REPRODUCTION TO THE INSTITUTIONAL TERRAIN OF NEOLIBERAL RESTRUCTURING. KEY TO THIS STRUGGLE IS COMBATTING NEOLIBERAL LOGICS OF MOTHER-BLAME THAT LOCATE RISK WITHIN THE LABOR OF CAREGIVING.

HOWEVER, PUERTO RICAN MIDWIVES AND DOULAS CURRENTLY HAVE LESS INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT THAN EVER. IN A TIME OF QUARANTINE WHEN HOME BIRTHS ARE RISING, WE NEED TO CONSIDER WHETHER SOCIETY IS DESIGNED TO FACILITATE THESE MODELS OF CARE.

STUDY DESIGN: WE RECRUITED OBSTETRICIAN-GYNECOLOGISTS PRACTICING IN TEN GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE US STATES FOR A QUALITATIVE STUDY USING THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OBSTETRICIANS AND GYNECOLOGISTS DIRECTORY. WE CONDUCTED SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS VIA TELEPHONE, PROFESSIONALLY TRANSCRIBED, AND ANALYZED USING THE CONSTANT COMPARATIVE METHOD AND PRINCIPLES OF GROUNDED THEORY. RESULTS: WE INTERVIEWED THIRTY OBSTETRICIAN-GYNECOLOGISTS (63.3\% WOMEN, 76.7\% NON-SUBSPECIALIZED, AND 53.3\% ACADEMIC SETTING). PARTICIPANTS LARGELY DESCRIBED THE CONSENT FORM AS UNNECESSARY, PATERNALISTIC, AN ADMINISTRATIVE HASSLE, A BARRIER TO DESIRED PATIENT CARE, AND ASSOCIATED WITH WORSE HEALTH OUTCOMES. VIEWS ON THE WAITING PERIOD'S UTILITY AND IMPACT WERE MIXED. MANY PARTICIPANTS FELT THE STERILIZATION POLICY WAS DISCRIMINATORY. HOWEVER, SOME PARTICIPANTS NOTED THE POLICY'S IMPORTANCE IN TERMS OF THE HISTORICAL BASIS, USED THE FORM AS A COUNSELING TOOL TO REMIND PATIENTS OF THE PERMANENCE OF STERILIZATION, FELT THE POLICY PROMPTED THEM TO COUNSEL REGARDING STERILIZATION, AND PROTECTED PATIENTS IN CONTEMPORARY MEDICAL PRACTICE. CONCLUSION: MANY PHYSICIANS SHARED CONCERNS ABOUT THE ETHICS AND CLINICAL IMPACT OF THE MEDICAID STERILIZATION POLICY. FUTURE REVISIONS TO THE MEDICAID STERILIZATION POLICY MUST BALANCE PREVENTION OF COERCION WITH REDUCTION IN BARRIERS TO THOSE DESIRING STERILIZATION IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE REPRODUCTIVE AUTONOMY.

PARALLELS BETWEEN FEMINIST-OF-COLOR THEORY AND THE ARGUMENTS MADE BY PRISONER ADVOCATES SUGGEST THAT BECAUSE PRISONERS HAVE BEEN RELEGATED TO A REALM OF SOCIAL DEATH, NONCOERCIVE INFORMED CONSENT IS NOT ACTUALLY POSSIBLE. I THEREFORE CONSIDER THE ROLE OF INFORMED CONSENT IN DISCIPLINING INCARCERATED PEOPLE OF COLOR AND POOR PEOPLE INCARCERATED IN WOMEN'S PRISONS.

THIS STUDY OFFERS PSYCHOLOGY AN EMPIRICAL AND ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK FOR MOVING FORWARD WITH ITS CONCEPTUALIZATIONS OF HOW RACE, GENDER, AND CLASS INTERSECT IN SERVICE OF REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE. RESULTS FROM THIS STUDY CAN BE USED BY CLINICIANS TO GUIDE THEIR CLIENTS TOWARDS HEALING GENDERED-RACIST-RELATED STRESS, AS WELL AS MEDICAL SCHOOLS TO EDUCATE OBSTETRICIANS AND GYNECOLOGISTS ON HOW TO PROVIDE ANTI-RACIST CARE TO THEIR BLACK PATIENTS.";"10.1177/03616843231168113";"ARTICLE"

KNOWLEDGE DEVELOPMENTA CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF CURRENT BLACK MATERNAL HEALTH TEACHING AND RESEARCH PRACTICES IN NURSING INFORMED BY THE AUTHORS' EXPERIENCE IN BLACK/AFRICAN DIASPORIC MATERNAL HEALTH AND REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE. DISCUSSIONTHERE IS A NEED FOR NURSING TO BE MORE INTENTIONAL IN ADDRESSING THE EFFECTS OF SYSTEMIC RACISM ON BLACK MATERNAL HEALTH OUTCOMES. IN PARTICULAR, THERE IS STILL A SUBSTANTIAL FOCUS ON RACE RATHER THAN RACISM AS A RISK FACTOR. THE FOCUS ON RACIAL AND CULTURAL DIFFERENCES RATHER THAN SYSTEMS OF OPPRESSION CONTINUES TO PATHOLOGIZE RACIALIZED GROUPS WHILE FAILING TO ADDRESS THE IMPACT OF SYSTEMIC RACISM ON THE HEALTH OUTCOMES OF BLACK WOMEN. CONCLUSIONUSING A SOCIAL DETERMINANT OF HEALTH FRAMEWORK TO EXAMINE MATERNAL HEALTH DISPARITIES IS USEFUL; HOWEVER, FOCUSING ON SDOH WITHOUT CHALLENGING SYSTEMS OF OPPRESSION PRODUCING THESE DISPARITIES DOES NOT PRODUCE SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES. WE SUGGEST ADDING FRAMEWORKS GROUNDED IN INTERSECTIONALITY, REPRODUCTIVE AND RACIAL JUSTICE AND MOVING BEYOND BIOLOGICAL ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT RACE THAT PATHOLOGIZE BLACK WOMEN. WE ALSO RECOMMEND A DELIBERATE COMMITMENT TO RESHAPING NURSING RESEARCH AND EDUCATION TO CENTRE ANTI-RACIST AND ANTI-COLONIAL PRACTICES THAT VALUE COMMUNITY KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICES.

DESIGN THIS STUDY GATHERED DATA FROM BLACK MOTHERS (N = 209) WHO HAD GIVEN BIRTH WITHIN THE PAST TWO YEARS, USING A CROSS-SECTIONAL ONLINE SURVEY MEASURING SEVERAL VARIABLES ABOUT THE BIRTHING EXPERIENCE INCLUDING TYPES OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDER COMMUNICATION, PROVIDER RESPECT FOR THE MOTHER, TRUST, BIRTH SATISFACTION, AND EMOTIONAL RESPONSES TO BIRTH. RESULTS PROVIDER-CENTERED COMMUNICATION, ALTHOUGH PREFERRED BY SOME MOTHERS, WAS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER BIRTH SATISFACTION AND STRONGER NEGATIVE EMOTIONS WHEREAS POSITIVE BIRTH SATISFACTION WAS LINKED TO PATIENT-CENTERED COMMUNICATION WHICH RESULTED IN POSITIVE EMOTIONS. WHILE MOST MOTHERS REPORTED OVERALL SATISFACTION WITH THEIR BIRTH EXPERIENCE, NEARLY HALF REPORTED EXPERIENCING SOME DEGREE OF DISRESPECT FROM THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS DURING LABOR AND BIRTH.

PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED DEATHS ARE RISING IN THE USA AND ARE HIGHER THAN IN OTHER DEVELOPED NATIONS. PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED MORTALITY RATES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGHER AMONG NON-HISPANIC BLACK WOMEN. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO (1) REVIEW THE CURRENT LITERATURE REGARDING PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE PREVALENCE IN BLACK WOMEN COMPARED WITH WOMEN OF OTHER RACES/ETHNICITIES, (2) REVIEW PROPOSED FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THESE HEALTH DISPARITIES, AND (3) DISCUSS POTENTIAL AVENUES TO ADDRESS THESE DISPARITIES IN THE NAME OF REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE. RECENT FINDINGS THERE IS A PAUCITY OF DATA REGARDING FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO DISPARITIES IN HEALTH AMONG BLACK PREGNANT WOMEN, BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT THESE CANNOT BE FULLY EXPLAINED BY DIFFERENCES IN SOCIOECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS, ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE, OR HEALTHCARE LITERACY. ADDITIONALLY, ALTHOUGH SOME CARDIOVASCULAR-RELATED PREGNANCY MORTALITY ETIOLOGIES SUCH AS HEMORRHAGE, PULMONARY EMBOLISM, AND HYPERTENSIVE DISORDERS OF PREGNANCY ARE DECREASING IN INCIDENCE, OTHER PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES AND CARDIOMYOPATHY RATES ARE INCREASING. ALTHOUGH THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY BEHIND PERIPARTUM CARDIOMYOPATHY IS STILL UNCLEAR, ITS PREVALENCE IS HIGH AMONG BLACK WOMEN. STUDIES ARE LACKING PROBING THE INFLUENCE OF PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS ON PATIENT-PROVIDER RELATIONSHIPS AND PATIENT-CENTERED DECISION-MAKING AMONG BLACK WOMEN DURING PREGNANCY AND POSTPARTUM. BLACK WOMEN DISPROPORTIONATELY EXPERIENCE HIGHER PREGNANCY-RELATED CARDIOVASCULAR MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY COMPARED WITH WHITE WOMEN. MORE STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO FILL THE GAP IN THE LITERATURE DATA REGARDING THE CAUSES OF THIS SIGNIFICANT HEALTH DISPARITY. A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE VARIOUS FACTORS DRIVING THESE MATERNAL HEALTH DISPARITIES COULD INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOLISTIC, MULTIFACETED APPROACHES TO CARING FOR BLACK WOMEN IN PREGNANCY AND POSTPARTUM.

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTIONS: USING A MIXED-METHOD DESIGN, WE CONDUCTED 30 IN-PERSON INTERVIEWS WITH ADOLESCENT LARC USERS WHO WERE ENROLLED IN SCHOOL-BASED HEALTH CENTERS IN NEW YORK CITY. INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED IN 2 PHASES: DURING PHASE 1, 12 PARTICIPANTS VIEWED A PILOT VERSION OF THE APP (MYLARC); DURING PHASE 2, 18 ADDITIONAL PARTICIPANTS INTERACTED WITH AN EXPANDED VERSION OF THE APP. PHASE 2 PARTICIPANTS DOWNLOADED MYLARC ONTO THEIR SMARTPHONE AND APP USAGE WAS TRACKED. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PARTICIPANTS' RESPONSES TO THE IN-PERSON INTERVIEWS AND DATA USAGE OF MYLARC FROM PHASE 2 DETERMINED THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF USING MYLARC TO SUPPORT YOUNG WOMEN'S SATISFACTION AND CONTINUATION OF LARC METHODS. RESULTS: NONEDUCATIONAL GAMES WERE RECOMMENDED AS AN APPROACH TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO ADOLESCENTS IN AN ENGAGING WAY, AS WELL AS EDUCATIONAL GRAPHICS AND VISUALLY APPEALING CONTENT. DATA TRACKING OF MYLARC USAGE AMONG PHASE 2 PARTICIPANTS REVEALED A TOTAL OF 67 UNIQUE LOGINS TO THE APP WITH 18 AVERAGE PAGE VISITS PER UNIQUE LOGIN.

GROUNDED THEORY METHODOLOGY INFORMED SAMPLING AND THEMATIC ANALYSIS WITHIN AND ACROSS SECTORS.RESULTS: KEY INFORMANTS ACROSS SECTORS SUPPORTED INTEGRATING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES INTO PRIMARY CARE. PREGNANCY INTENTION SCREENING WAS CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE YET REQUIRED IMPROVED MEASURES. SUCH SCREENING WAS VIEWED AS FOSTERING CHILDBEARING DISCUSSIONS AND COUNSELING FOR CONTRACEPTION/PRECONCEPTION HEALTH THAT COULD BENEFIT PATIENTS WHILE ALSO REQUIRING ATTENTION TO CONCERNS FROM THE PATIENT (E.G., POTENTIAL FOR COERCION, ACCESS BARRIERS) AND HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS (E.G., BUY-IN, TRAINING) CONTEXTS. THREE THEMES RELATED TO LARC INCLUDED PROVIDER BIAS, KNOWLEDGE AND TRAINING, COUNSELING AND PATIENT EDUCATION, AND LOGISTICS/FINANCIAL SITUATION, WHICH WERE DIFFERENTIALLY EM PHASIZED BY STAKEHOLDER SECTOR; PROVIDERS EXPRESSED GREATER CONCERN REGARDING TRAINING, BIAS, AND LOGISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS, WHEREAS HEALTH EDUCATORS AND ADVOCATES FOCUSED ON PATIENT EDUCATION AND AUTONOMOUS DECISION-MAKING. SIMILARLY, AWARENESS OF REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE PRINCIPLES VARIED BY SECTOR.CONCLUSION: THERE IS CONSENSUS AMONG INFORMANTS FROM THE 5 SECTORS FOR EXPANDING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES IN PRIMARY CARE. THIS WILL REQUIRE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH-RELATED TRAINING FOR PROVIDERS, ORGANIZATIONAL BUY-IN, AND SYSTEM PROTOCOL CHANGES, INCLUDING UNBIASED CONTRACEPTIVE COUNSELING OF ALL METHODS, SPECIFICALLY BALANCING DISCUSSION OF LARC EFFECTIVENESS WITH INFORMATION REGARDING SIDE EFFECTS. INCORPORATING REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE PRINCIPLES MAY INCREASE INFORMED PATIENT DECISION-MAKING AND REPRODUCTIVE AUTONOMY. IMPLICATIONS: EXPANDING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES IN PRIMARY CARE REQUIRES PROVIDER TRAINING AND PROTOCOLS FOR PATIENT-CENTERED CARE, INCLUDING UNBIASED PROVISION OF ALL CONTRACEPTIVE OPTIONS.

STUDY DESIGN: RESPONDENTS WERE SELF-IDENTIFIED WOMEN WITH CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM INVOLVEMENT. DATA COME FROM A CROSS-SECTIONAL BASELINE SURVEY OF 381 WOMEN IN THREE U.S. CITIES: OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA, KANSAS CITY, KANSAS/MISSOURI, AND BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME, HIGH ABORTION-RELATED KNOWLEDGE, WAS BASED ON A 10-ITEM SCALE DICHOTOMIZED INTO LOW VS HIGH ABORTION-RELATED KNOWLEDGE. WE USED DE-SCRIPTIVE STATISTICS, BIVARIABLE ASSOCIATIONS, AND LOGISTIC REGRESSION TO ASSESS THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN HIGH ABORTION-RELATED KNOWLEDGE, CITY OF RESIDENCE, AND OTHER POSSIBLE RELATED FACTORS. RESULTS: RESPONDENTS IN KANSAS CITY, KS/MO AND BIRMINGHAM, AL HAD LOWER ODDS OF HIGH ABORTION-RELATED KNOWLEDGE COMPARED TO RESPONDENTS IN OAKLAND, CA (OR: 0.19, 95\% CI: 0.10-0.38 AND OR: 0.17, 95\% CI: 0.11-0.28, RESPECTIVELY).

THESE WERE PART OF A BROADER POLITICAL AGENDA FOR RE-DEMOCRATISATION, AND FOR HEALTH SECTOR REFORM, WITH THE CREATION OF THE WOMEN'S INTEGRAL HEALTH PROGRAM (PAISM) IN 1983, AND OF THE UNIVERSAL HEALTH SYSTEM (SUS) IN 1988. THE MOMENTUM CREATED BY ICPD IN CAIRO (1994) WAS ESSENTIAL TO INSTITUTIONALISE THE LANGUAGE OF RHR. NOT WITHOUT RESISTANCE AND ORGANISED ACTIVISM, RECENT YEARS OF RIGHT-WING GOVERNMENTS BROUGHT A DISINVESTMENT IN MOST PUBLIC POLICIES FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS. SOME COMPONENTS OF THE RHR AGENDA ARE MORE MAINSTREAMED, SUCH AS FERTILITY REGULATION, ESPECIALLY HORMONAL AND LONG TERM-METHODS. THE LIMITED LEGAL RIGHTS TO ABORTION ARE POORLY INSTITUTIONALISED AND CONSTANTLY THREATENED. MATERNAL CARE TENDS TO BE HIGHLY MEDICALISED AND FREQUENTLY ABUSIVE. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ACCELERATED SOCIAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH DISRUPTION. THE ARTICLE ADDRESSES NOTIONS SUCH AS REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE AND INSTITUTIONAL VIOLENCE, PRESENT IN THE EARLY DAYS OF WOMEN'S HEALTH MOVEMENT, IN ORDER TO HIGHLIGHT IMPORTANT PREMISES THAT WERE DILUTED IN THE DEBATE ON REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AND AUTONOMY.

THE CLINICAL, ECONOMICAL, AND ETHICAL IMPLICATIONS OF UNINTENDED PREGNANCY SHOULD PROMPT ANESTHESIOLOGISTS TO ACTIVELY CONSIDER AND MANAGE THIS PHARMACOLOGIC INTERACTION. WE SURVEYED ANESTHESIOLOGY PROVIDERS AT OUR INSTITUTION ABOUT KNOWLEDGE OF THIS POTENTIAL ADVERSE DRUG INTERACTION, HOW THEY MANAGE IT CLINICALLY, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY INVOLVE PATIENTS IN SHARED DECISION-MAKING REGARDING CHOICE OF NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKER ANTAGONIST. METHODS: A SURVEY INSTRUMENT WAS DISTRIBUTED TO ANESTHESIOLOGY PROVIDERS AT A LARGE, TERTIARY-CARE MEDICAL CENTER. THE SURVEY EXPLORED PRIOR EXPERIENCE USING NEOSTIGMINE AND SUGAMMADEX, KNOWLEDGE ABOUT POTENTIAL SUGAMMADEX INTERFERENCE WITH HORMONAL CONTRACEPTION, PRE-/POSTOPERATIVE COUNSELING PRACTICES, CLINICAL MANAGEMENT, AND SHARED DECISION-MAKING REGARDING POTENTIAL USE OF NEOSTIGMINE IN LIEU OF SUGAMMADEX TO AVOID THIS DRUG-DRUG INTERACTION. RESULTS: OF 259 SURVEYS DISTRIBUTED, 155 WERE FULLY COMPLETED, AND 10 WERE PARTIALLY COMPLETED. OVERALL RESPONSE RATE WAS 60\% (RESIDENTS 85\%, STUDENT NURSE ANESTHETISTS 53\%, CERTIFIED REGISTERED NURSE ANESTHETISTS 58\%, ATTENDINGS 48\%). ALL BUT 1 RESPONDENT RECOGNIZED THE POTENTIAL FOR SUGAMMADEX INTERFERENCE WITH ORAL HORMONAL CONTRACEPTION. FAR FEWER ACCURATELY IDENTIFIED POTENTIAL INTERFERENCE WITH HORMONAL INTRAUTERINE DEVICES (44\%) AND HORMONAL CONTRACEPTIVE IMPLANTS (55\%). THE MANUFACTURER'S RECOMMENDED 7-DAY DURATION OF ALTERNATIVE CONTRACEPTION WAS CORRECTLY IDENTIFIED BY 72\% OF RESPONDENTS; OTHERS (22\%) REPORTED LONGER DURATIONS (RANGE 10-30 DAYS). MOST (78\% OVERALL) AGREED/STRONGLY AGREED THAT POTENTIAL INTERFERENCE WITH CONTRACEPTIVE EFFECTIVENESS SHOULD BE DISCUSSED WITH PATIENTS PREOPERATIVELY. DESPITE THE MAJORITY (86\% OVERALL) THAT ENDORSED SHARED DECISION-MAKING AND INVITING PATIENT INPUT REGARDING CHOICE BETWEEN SUGAMMADEX AND NEOSTIGMINE, MANY RESPONDENTS REPORTED ``RARELY/NEVER'' HAVING DISCUSSED THIS DRUG INTERACTION WITH PATIENTS IN ACTUAL CLINICAL PRACTICE, EITHER PREOPERATIVELY (67\%) OR POSTOPERATIVELY (80\%). FURTHERMORE, MOST RESPONDENTS (79\%) REPORTED ``RARELY/NEVER'' ADMINISTERING NEOSTIGMINE TO INTENTIONALLY AVOID THIS DRUG INTERACTION. CONCLUSIONS: TWO YEARS AFTER DESIGNATING SUGAMMADEX AS ANTAGONIST OF CHOICE, PHYSICIAN AND NURSE ANESTHESIA PROVIDERS REPORTED SELDOM INQUIRING ABOUT CONTRACEPTIVE USE AMONG WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING POTENTIAL AND RARELY DISCUSSING POTENTIAL RISK OF CONTRACEPTIVE FAILURE FROM SUGAMMADEX EXPOSURE.

STUDY DESIGN: WE CONDUCTED A SURVEY WITH IM ATTENDINGS AND TRAINEES AT A LARGE ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER IN WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA. WE USED DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS TO CHARACTERIZE ATTITUDES TOWARDS MEDICATION ABORTION PROVISION, INCLUDING THE BELIEF THAT IT IS WITHIN THEIR SCOPE OF PRACTICE AND INTEREST IN FUTURE PROVISION, AND TO EXPLORE PERCEIVED BARRIERS TO PROVISION. WE USED LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELS TO ASSESS FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF THESE ATTITUDES. RESULTS: OF 397 ELIGIBLE ATTENDINGS AND TRAINEES, 121 (30\%) COMPLETED THE SURVEY. AMONG THOSE SURVEYED, 44\% BELIEVED MEDICATION ABORTION IS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE OF IM PCPS WITH TRAINEES AND FEMALE-IDENTIFYING PROVIDERS BEING SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO BELIEVE MEDICATION ABORTION IS WITHIN THEIR SCOPE OF PRACTICE COMPARED TO ATTENDING PHYSICIANS AND MALE PHYSICIANS (60\% VS 30\%, P < 0.01 AND 53\% VS 31\%, P = 0.01, RESPECTIVELY). SIMILARLY, 43\% ENDORSED INTEREST IN FUTURE PROVISION, WITH TRAINEES (67\% VS 23\%, P < 0.001) AND FEMALE PROVIDERS (54\% VS 27\%, P = 0.002) BEING MORE LIKELY TO EXPRESS INTEREST. THE MOST CITED BARRIERS TO PROVISION INCLUDED LIMITED TRAINING IN RESIDENCY (70\%) AND LOW FAMILIARITY WITH ABORTION MEDICATIONS (57\%). CONCLUSIONS: MANY IM PROVIDERS-PARTICULARLY TRAINEES-BELIEVE MEDICATION ABORTION IS WITHIN THEIR SCOPE OF PRACTICE AND WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE THIS CARE.

PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE IS ACCESS TO SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES (SRHS).

IN THIS PAPER I TAKE UP PART OF THIS WORK AND ATTEMPT TO CLARIFY THE RELEVANT KIND OF FREEDOM AN ADEQUATE THEORY OF REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE WOULD POSTULATE. TO DO SO, I COMPARE TWO APPROACHES TO REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM: AN APPROACH BASED ON FREEDOM AS NON-INTERFERENCE AND AN APPROACH BASED ON FREEDOM AS NON-DOMINATION.

HERE, WE USE DATA FROM SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH 17 PATIENTS AT A SEXUAL HEALTH CLINIC ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE OBTAINING CONTRACEPTION TO EXPLORE THE PROCESS OF CHOOSING A METHOD. PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED THROUGH POSTERS IN THE CLINIC WAITING ROOM AND VIA INFORMATION POSTED ON THE CLINIC'S SOCIAL MEDIA FEEDS. INTERVIEWS WERE THEMATICALLY ANALYZED, AND TWO MAIN THEMES IDENTIFIED. THE FIRST THEME WAS THE IMPORTANCE OF SEEKING OUT INFORMATION ONLINE AND FROM SOCIAL NETWORKS PRIOR TO SEEING A PROVIDER, TO THE EXTENT THAT MOST PARTICIPANTS HAD SETTLED ON A METHOD PRIOR TO THEIR DISCUSSION WITH A PHYSICIAN. THE SECOND THEME WAS THE PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED BY PARTICIPANTS IN THEIR DECISION-MAKING, PRIMARILY SIDE EFFECTS.

THIS AREA IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT AS RECENT ATTACKS ON REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE IMPACT NOT ONLY BIRTHING PEOPLE'S RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS BUT ALSO THEIR MENTAL HEALTH AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING. CURRENT PSYCHOTHERAPY INTERVENTIONS ARE ROOTED IN EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENTS (EBTS) THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS ALIGN WITH THE VALUES AND PRACTICES OF FRAMEWORKS LIKE RADICAL HEALING AND LIBERATION PSYCHOLOGY THAT ARE MEANT TO EMPHASIZE COLLECTIVE HEALING AND EMPOWER INDIVIDUALS. TO DATE, PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH INVOLVING RADICAL HEALING AND LIBERATION PSYCHOLOGY APPROACHES HAVE NOT HAD A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON BIRTHING PEOPLE. PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS HAVE ALSO LARGELY EXCLUDED THE UNIQUE INTERSECTIONAL IDENTITIES AND HEALING OF BLACK BIRTHING PEOPLE. IN MOVING TOWARD DECOLONIZING PSYCHOTHERAPY, THIS CONCEPTUAL PAPER WILL PROPOSE A MULTI-PRONGED FRAMEWORK FOR ADDRESSING RACIAL STRESSORS AND OTHER MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS DURING THE PERINATAL PERIOD. THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK, THE THREE CS OF DECOLONIZATION, INCLUDES THREE COMPONENTS: COMMUNITY, CREATIVITY, AND CONNECTION TO SELF. THESE COMPONENTS OF THE FRAMEWORK ARE MEANT TO ADDRESS AND HIGHLIGHT CULTURALLY RELEVANT WAYS OF HEALING FOR BLACK BIRTHING PEOPLE. LARGER SYSTEMIC CHANGES ARE NEEDED AND NECESSARY FOR THE DESIRED CHANGE ACROSS MENTAL HEALTH, MEDICAL, AND OTHER INTEGRATED SYSTEMS OF CARE THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY RACISM AND DISCRIMINATION. THE CURRENT FRAMEWORK IS DEDICATED TO HEALING AND EMPOWERING BLACK BIRTHING PEOPLE WITH APPROACHES AND CONSIDERATIONS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE.";"10.1080/10894160.2024.2356994";"ARTICLE; EARLY ACCESS"

AT THE SAME TIME, THIS THERAPEUTIC OPTION IS ENORMOUSLY COMPLEX WHEN CONSIDERED FROM A HISTORICAL, SOCIOLOGICAL, OR ETHICAL PERSPECTIVE. THIS COMMITTEE STATEMENT REVIEWS ETHICAL ISSUES RELATED TO PERMANENT CONTRACEPTION USING A REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE FRAMEWORK. ETHICAL COUNSELING AND SHARED DECISION MAKING FOR PERMANENT CONTRACEPTION SHOULD ADOPT A NONJUDGMENTAL, PATIENT-CENTERED APPROACH, USING UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ABOUT PERMANENT CONTRACEPTION PROCEDURES AND ALTERNATIVES. OBSTETRICIAN-GYNECOLOGISTS SHOULD STRIVE TO AVOID BRINGING INTO THE CLINICAL ENCOUNTER BIASES AROUND GENDER, RACE, AGE, AND CLASS THAT AFFECT THOUGHTS ON WHO SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT BECOME A PARENT. OBSTETRICIAN-GYNECOLOGISTS SHOULD ALSO ENSURE THAT PERMANENT CONTRACEPTION REQUESTS REFLECT EACH PATIENT'S WISHES, COME FROM A DESIRE TO PERMANENTLY END CHILDBEARING, AND COME FROM A PREFERENCE FOR PERMANENT CONTRACEPTION OVER ALL REVERSIBLE METHODS AS WELL AS PERMANENT CONTRACEPTION FOR THE MALE PARTNER. WHEN DIFFICULTIES IN MEETING A POSTPARTUM PERMANENT CONTRACEPTION REQUEST ARE ANTICIPATED AND PERMANENT CONTRACEPTION IS DESIRED BY THE PATIENT, TRANSFER OF CARE FOR THE REMAINDER OF PREGNANCY SHOULD BE OFFERED. ACOG RECOGNIZES THE RIGHT OF ALL PATIENTS TO UNIMPEDED ACCESS TO PERMANENT CONTRACEPTION AS A WAY OF ENSURING HEALTH EQUITY, BUT IT IS UNCLEAR HOW TO CRAFT POLICIES THAT PROTECT FROM COERCION BUT ALSO DO NOT CREATE BARRIERS TO AUTONOMOUSLY DESIRED CARE.

RACIAL DIFFERENCES IN SA CHARACTERISTICS AND HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION AFTER SA ARE LARGELY UNKNOWN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: WE REVIEWED MEDICAL RECORDS OF 690 INDIVIDUALS (23.9\% BLACK; 93.6\% WOMEN) WHO RECEIVED A SA MEDICAL FORENSIC EXAM (SAMFE) AT A SOUTHEASTERN U.S. HOSPITAL. WE EXAMINED BIVARIATE RACIAL DIFFERENCES IN SA CHARACTERISTICS AND USED ZERO-INFLATED POISSON REGRESSIONS TO ESTIMATE RACIAL DIFFERENCES IN MENTAL HEALTH OUTPATIENT VISITS AT THE SAMFE HOSPITAL. RESULTS: AMONG SURVIVORS OF SA, BLACK SURVIVORS WERE MORE LIKELY THAN WHITE SURVIVORS TO HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED BY AN INTIMATE PARTNER (ODDS RATIO [OR] = 1.77, CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [95\% CI] = 1.02-3.07) AND THEY HAD MORE POST-SA OUTPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH VISITS AT THE SAMFE HOSPITAL (INCIDENCE RATE RATIO [IRR] = 2.05, 95\% CI = 1.70-2.47). BLACK SURVIVORS WERE LESS LIKELY TO REPORT ALCOHOL OR DRUG USE BEFORE THE SA (OR = 0.42, 95\% CI = 0.28-0.62). IN MULTIVARIABLE MODELS, BLACK SURVIVORS TRENDED TOWARD MORE MENTAL HEALTH VISITS THAN WHITE SURVIVORS (IRR = 1.63, 95\% CI = 0.82-2.44), BUT INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE (IPV) SIGNIFICANTLY MODERATED THAT ASSOCIATION (IRR = 0.01, 95\%CI = <= 0.001-0.03). BLACK SURVIVORS ASSAULTED BY AN INTIMATE PARTNER WERE LESS LIKELY TO ACCESS MENTAL HEALTH CARE THAN WHITE IPV SURVIVORS. CONCLUSIONS: THE HOSPITAL SETTING OF A SAMFE COULD BE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE BLACK SURVIVORS AND REDUCE RACIAL DISPARITIES IN MENTAL HEALTH SEQUELAE, BUT ADDITIONAL SUPPORT WILL BE NEEDED FOR BLACK SURVIVORS EXPERIENCING IPV.

RESTRICTIVE ABORTION LAWS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO POOR INFANT HEALTH OUTCOMES. THIS ECOLOGICAL STUDY INVESTIGATED THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN COUNTY-LEVEL INFANT MORTALITY AND STATE-LEVEL ABORTION ACCESS LEGISLATION IN THE U.S. FROM 2014 TO 2018. METHODS: A MULTIVARIABLE REGRESSION ANALYSIS WITH THE OUTCOME OF COUNTY-LEVEL INFANT MORTALITY RATES, CONTROLLING FOR THE PRIMARY EXPOSURE OF STATE-LEVEL ABORTION LAWS, AND COUNTY-LEVEL FACTORS, COUNTY-LEVEL DISTANCE TO AN ABORTION FACILITY, AND STATE MEDICAID EXPANSION STATUS WAS PERFORMED. INCIDENCE RATE RATIOS AND 95\% CIS WERE REPORTED. ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED IN 2022-2023. RESULTS: THERE WERE 113,397 INFANT DEATHS AMONG 19,559,660 LIVE BIRTHS (INFANT MORTALITY RATE=5.79 DEATHS/1,000 LIVE BIRTHS; 95\% CI=5.75, 5.82). BLACK INFANT MORTALITY RATE (10.69/1,000) WAS MORE THAN TWICE THE WHITE INFANT MORTALITY RATE (4.87/1,000). IN THE MULTIVARIABLE MODEL, INCREASED INFANT MORTALITY RATES WERE SEEN IN STATES WITH >= 8 RESTRICTIVE LAWS, WITH THE MOST RESTRICTIVE (11-12 LAWS) HAVING A 16\% INCREASED INFANT MORTALITY LEVEL (ADJUSTED INCIDENCE RATE RATIOS=1.162; 95\% CI=1.103, 1.224). INCREASED INFANT MORTALITY RATES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED COUNTY-LEVEL BLACK RACE INDIVIDUALS (ADJUSTED INCIDENCE RATE RATIOS=1.031; 95\% CI=1.026, 1.037), HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION (ADJUSTED INCIDENCE RATE RATIOS=1.018; 95\% CI=1.008, 1.029), MATERNAL SMOKING (ADJUSTED INCIDENCE RATE RATIOS=1.025; 95\% CI=1.018, 1.033), AND INADEQUATE PRENATAL CARE (ADJUSTED INCIDENCE RATE RATIOS=1.045; 95\% CI=1.036, 1.055).

IN THE CONTEXT OF CLINICAL CARE, LANGUAGE HAS POWER AND MEANING AND REFLECTS PRIORITIES, BELIEFS, VALUES, AND CULTURE. STIGMATIZING LANGUAGE CAN COMMUNICATE UNINTENDED MEANINGS THAT PERPETUATE SOCIALLY CONSTRUCTED POWER DYNAMICS AND RESULT IN BIAS. THIS BIAS MAY HARM PREGNANT AND BIRTHING PEOPLE BY CENTERING POSITIONS OF POWER AND PRIVILEGE AND BY REFLECTING CULTURAL PRIORITIES IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING JUDGMENTS OF DEMOGRAPHIC AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CHARACTERISTICS. THIS COMMENTARY BUILDS ON RELATIONSHIP-CENTERED CARE AND REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE FRAMEWORKS TO ANALYZE THE ROLE AND USE OF LANGUAGE IN PREGNANCY AND BIRTH CARE IN THE UNITED STATES, PARTICULARLY REGARDING PEOPLE WITH MARGINALIZED IDENTITIES. WE DESCRIBE THE USE OF LANGUAGE IN WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION, VERBAL COMMUNICATION, AND BEHAVIORS ASSOCIATED WITH CARING FOR PREGNANT PEOPLE. WE ALSO PRESENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CHANGE, INCLUDING ALTERNATIVE LANGUAGE AT THE INDIVIDUAL, CLINICIAN, HOSPITAL, HEALTH SYSTEMS, AND POLICY LEVELS. WE DEFINE BIRTH AS THE EMERGENCE OF A NEW INDIVIDUAL FROM THE BODY OF ITS PARENT, NO MATTER WHAT INTERVENTION OR PATHOLOGY MAY BE INVOLVED.

THE CONSERVATIVE LAESTADIANS IN FINLAND ARE ONE EXAMPLE OF A CONSERVATIVE PROCREATIONAL RELIGIOUS MOVEMENT THAT REQUIRES ABSTINENCE FROM PREMARITAL SEX AND UPHOLDS A NEGATIVE ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE USE OF BIRTH CONTROL. IN THIS ARTICLE, I FOLLOW YOUNG FORMER CONSERVATIVE LAESTADIAN WOMEN'S VIEWS ON REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM, PROCREATIONAL ETHOS, AND PRONATALIST POLITICS. I PROPOSE THAT THERE IS AN ONGOING UPSURGE AMONG YOUNG FORMER CONSERVATIVE LAESTADIAN WOMEN WHO RESIST THE MOVEMENT'S PROCREATIONAL ETHOS. I ALSO SUGGEST THAT THE LAESTADIAN PROCREATIONAL ETHOS HAS AFFINITIES WITH THE NATIONALIST AND PRONATALIST AIMS OF PROMOTING LIMITLESS HUMAN REPRODUCTION.

THIS PAPER PRESENTS A POLICY ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF THIS DIRECTIVE ON PREGNANT LATINA MIGRANTS. THE DIRECTIVE IS CONTEXTUALIZED AS PART OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S ``ZERO-TOLERANCE'' IMMIGRATION POLICY THAT DIRECTED U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICES ALONG THE SOUTHWEST BORDER IN APRIL OF 2018 TO CRIMINALLY PROSECUTE ALL CASES INVOLVING ILLEGAL ENTRY WITH NO EXCEPTIONS. UNDER THIS POLICY, LATIN AMERICAN MIGRANTS SEEKING ASYLUM IN THE USA FACED CRIMINALIZATION, FAMILY SEPARATION, AND DETENTION. REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE (R.J.)

THREE CASE STUDIES DEMONSTRATE THE REPRODUCTIVE AND HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IMPACTING PREGNANT, MIGRANT LATINAS SEEKING TO ENTER THE U.S. UNDER ``ZERO-TOLERANCE.''

THIS ABSENCE IS FIRST ADDRESSED FROM A THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THREE ARGUMENTS: THAT SRT CAN CONNECT ABORTION TO THE BIOLOGICAL REPRODUCTION OF LABOR POWER VIA GESTATIONAL LABOR, THAT ABORTION CAN MAKE GESTATIONAL LABOR LESS ALIENATING, AND THAT ABORTION CAN FUNCTION AS A REFUSAL OF PRODUCTIVISM AND REPRODUCTIVE SEXUALITY. THE ARTICLE THEN APPLIES THESE ARGUMENTS TO A PREEXISTING CASE STUDY OF REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE AND WOMEN IN CANADA'S SEASONAL AGRICULTURAL WORKER PROGRAM.

THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF BLOG POSTS AND COMMENT THREADS WRITTEN IN RESPONSE TO THE CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS, I FIND THAT PARTICIPANTS IN THE FEMINIST COUNTERPUBLIC OF BIRTH ADVOCACY UTILIZE THREE PRIMARY STRATEGIES: THEY REDEFINE VBAC AS ``JUST BIRTH'' RATHER THAN A MEDICAL ``PROCEDURE;'' THEY RECONTEXTUALIZE THE BIOMEDICAL USE OF ``RISK'' TO INCLUDE OTHER FACTORS OUTSIDE OF THE IMMEDIATE CONTEXT OF THE HOSPITAL; AND THEY REFRAME VBAC AS A RIGHT RATHER THAN A PREFERENCE. TOGETHER, THESE STRATEGIES WORK TOGETHER TO DEMONSTRATE THE INCOMMENSURABILITY OF ``SHARED DOCTOR-PATIENT DECISION MAKING'' WITHIN THE CURRENT BIOMEDICAL MODEL OF CARE. THIS MOVE, TOWARD A RIGHTS-BASED FRAMEWORK WITHIN A MORE HIGHLY CONTEXTUALIZED SYSTEMIC CRITIQUE OF HEALTH CARE, POSITIONS VBAC TO BE AN ISSUE THAT COULD LINK BIRTH ADVOCACY TO A LARGER FEMINIST HEALTH JUSTICE MOVEMENT.";"10.1080/07491409.2020.1737289";"ARTICLE"

FIVE INTERCONNECTED THEMES WERE GENERATED THROUGH THEMATIC ANALYSIS: (1) THERE IS A LOT OF PREJUDICE TOWARDS US, (2) WE ARE TREATED AS SICK BODIES, (3) THERE IS A LOT OF STEREOTYPES TOWARDS US, (4) OUR CARE IS LACKING IN QUALITY, AND (5) WE FEEL UNSAFE IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THESE THEMES HIGHLIGHT THE PERILS FACED BY BLACK WOMEN ACCESSING PREGNANCY AND INTRAPARTUM CARE.

SOCIOLOGISTS HAVE MUCH TO CONTRIBUTE TO CHARACTERIZING AND UNDERSTANDING ABORTION, PARTICULARLY FOLLOWING THE 2022 US SUPREME COURT DECISION OVERTURNING THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO ABORTION. THE DISCIPLINE ALSO HAS MUCH TO LEARN FROM STUDYING ABORTION AS A CASE.

NEVERTHELESS, TO DATE, THERE HAS BEEN NO INVESTIGATION INTO HOW CHILEAN MIDWIVES HAVE INCORPORATED INDUCED ABORTION CARE PROVISION INTO THEIR PROFESSIONAL IDENTITY. OBJECTIVE: TO ELUCIDATE HOW CHILEAN MIDWIVES UNDERSTAND AND PROVIDE ABORTION CARE AND HOW THEY HAVE (RE) DEFINED THEIR PROFESSIONAL IDENTITY TO INCLUDE INDUCED ABORTION CARE. THIS ARTICLE REPORTS THE FINDINGS OF THE SECOND PART OF THIS AIM. METHODS: THIS STUDY WAS UNDERPINNED BY A CONSTRUCTIVIST GROUNDED THEORY METHODOLOGY INFORMED BY A REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE AND FEMINIST PERSPECTIVE. MIDWIVES FROM CHILE WHO HAVE CARED FOR WOMEN UNDERGOING ABORTION WERE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY. AFTER PURPOSIVE AND THEORETICAL SAMPLING, FIFTEEN MIDWIVES WERE RECRUITED. FINDINGS: MIDWIVES' IDENTITY IS WOMAN-CENTRED, WITH HIGH VALUE PLACED ON THEIR ROLE PROTECTING LIFE. THESE TWO ASPECTS OF MIDWIVES' IDENTITY ARE IN CONTRADICTION WHEN PROVIDING ABORTION CARE. MIDWIVES' IDENTITY RESULTS FROM AND INFORMS MIDWIVES' PRACTICE. MIDWIFERY REGULATION INFLUENCES BOTH PRACTICE AND IDENTITY. THE MODEL `NAVIGATING A MAZE' EXPLAINS THE INTERACTION OF THESE THREE ELEMENTS. CONCLUSION: MIDWIVES' IDENTITY RESPONSE TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE CHILEAN ABORTION LAW IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW PROFESSIONAL IDENTITY MUST NAVIGATE REGULATION AND PRACTICE TO MAKE SENSE OF ITS PURPOSE.

WE PERFORMED A RETROSPECTIVE CHART REVIEW TO EXAMINE CONTRACEPTION INITIATION, STERILIZATION, AND POSTPARTUM VIRTUAL AND IN-PERSON VISIT ATTENDANCE RATES DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS (MARCH 15 TO SEPTEMBER 7, 2020) OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC COMPARED TO THE RATES IN THE SAME PERIOD IN THE YEAR PRIOR AT A SINGLE TERTIARY ACADEMIC CARE CENTER. WE ABSTRACTED DATA FROM THE FIRST PRENATAL VISIT THROUGH TWELVE WEEKS POSTPARTUM. RESULTS: WITH THE INITIATION OF VIRTUAL APPOINTMENTS, POSTPARTUM VISIT ATTENDANCE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED (94.6 \% VS 88.4 \%, P < 0.001) DURING THE PANDEMIC WITH NO DIFFERENCE IN OVERALL CONTRACEPTION UPTAKE (51 \% VS 54.1 \%, P = 0.2) OR STERILIZATION (11.0 \% VS 11.5 \%, P = 0.88).

INEQUITABLE HEALTH SYSTEM BARRIERS ALSO INTERFERE WITH TRUE IMPLEMENTATION OF CONTRACEPTIVE PCC.IMPLICATIONS: TRANSLATING CONTRACEPTIVE PCC INTO PRACTICE, ESPECIALLY FOR MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES, IS PARAMOUNT. TRAINING SHOULD TEACH CLINICIANS TO RECOGNIZE SYSTEMS OF STRUCTURAL INEQUITY AND DISCRIMINA-TION THAT HAVE INFORMED APPROACHES TO COUNSELING BUT ARE NOT REFLECTIVE OF PCC. INSTITUTIONAL POLICIES MUST ADDRESS HEALTH SYSTEM BARRIERS THAT ALSO HAMPER PCC.(C) 2022 THE AUTHOR(S). PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER INC.

METHODS: ETHICAL PRINCIPLES AS OUTLINED BY THE AMERICAN NURSES ASSOCIATION, BLACK MAMAS MATTER ALLIANCE, AND FEDERAL RESEARCH GUIDELINES ARE REVIEWED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF CONDUCTING MATERNAL MORTALITY-FOCUSED RESEARCH. IN ADDITION, COMMUNITY DEVELOPED RESEARCH FRAMEWORKS AND METHODOLOGIES ARE PRESENTED AND DISCUSSED WITHIN THE RESEARCH CONTEXT. CONCLUSIONS: BLACK PREGNANT PEOPLE HAVE REPORTED MISTREATMENT DURING CLINICAL ENCOUNTERS; THEREFORE, INTENTIONAL PROTECTIONS TO PROMOTE SAFETY MUST BE CONSIDERED IN THE RESEARCH SETTING. ETHICAL PRINCIPLES MUST BE CONSIDERED WHEN DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING RESEARCH INITIATIVES FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING MATERNAL MORTALITY RISK IN BLACK COMMUNITIES.";"10.1097/JPN.0000000000000646";"ARTICLE"

THE BURDEN OF AN UNPLANNED PREGNANCY IS NOT EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED AMONG RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS IN THE UNITED STATES BASED ON THE RATES OF UNPLANNED PREGNANCIES. OBJECTIVE: THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE DISPARITY IN THE UTILIZATION OF CONTRACEPTION AMONG BLACK WOMEN THROUGH A REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE LENS. RESULTS: THE REASONS FOR THESE DIFFERENCES INCLUDE A LACK OF ACCESS TO CARE, AND DIFFERENCES IN CONTRACEPTIVE FAILURE RATES AMONG RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS, AS WELL AS LESS OF AN INCLINATION TO HAVE AN ABORTION. BARRIERS TO CONTRACEPTION FOR BREASTFEEDING PERSONS INCLUDE PATIENT MEDICAL CONDITIONS AND CONCERNS, AND RESISTANCE BY OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS DUE TO LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL DIFFERENCES, AND KNOWLEDGE ASYMMETRY.

IN THIS COMMENTARY, TARGETED RECOMMENDATIONS TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TOWARD LATINX WOMEN WILL BE PROVIDED, INCLUDING CULTURALLY COMPETENT BIRTH CONTROL COUNSELING AND A FOCUS ON REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE. NOT SPEAKING ENGLISH, LOW SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, ACCULTURATION, LEGAL STATUS, AND BEING UNINSURED ARE ALL TEENAGE PREGNANCY RISK FACTORS UNIQUE TO LATINX WOMEN. CULTURAL PREFERENCES AND ATTITUDES TOWARD CONTRACEPTION MUST ALSO BE CONSIDERED. FURTHER EXPANSION OF MEDICAID INSURANCE COVERAGE IS ALSO NECESSARY TO INCREASE REPRODUCTIVE ACCESS AMONG VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. A CULTURAL HUMILITY FRAMEWORK TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH COUNSELING AND SERVICES IS RECOMMENDED. WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK, FAMILY ENGAGEMENT IS ENCOURAGED, AND WOMEN ARE FREE FROM REPRODUCTIVE COERCION; THEY HAVE THE FREEDOM TO ACCESS OVER-THE-COUNTER CONTRACEPTION AND RECEIVE GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT FROM PROVIDERS AND COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS WHO ARE COGNIZANT OF CULTURE AND HERITAGE.

PERSONS IMPACTED BY SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH (SDH) MAY BE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EVALUATE THE ASSOCIATION OF SDH WITH PATIENT-REPORTED DIFFICULT LARC DISCONTINUATION.METHODS: A RETROSPECTIVE CROSS-SECTIONAL ANALYSIS OF DATA FROM THE 2017-2019 CYCLE OF THE NATIONAL SURVEY OF FAMILY GROWTH WAS CONDUCTED. THE MAIN OUTCOME WAS PATIENT-REPORTED DIFFICULTY DISCONTINUING A LARC METHOD (INTRAUTERINE DEVICE OR IMPLANT) IN THE LAST 10 YEARS. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS WERE USED TO IDENTIFY DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS AND SDH DOMAINS. MULTIVARIABLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELS WERE USED TO ESTIMATE ASSOCIATIONS ACROSS SDH DOMAINS WITH DIFFICULT LARC REMOVAL.RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 754 RESPONDENTS REPORTED WANTING TO HAVE THEIR LARC REMOVED, AND 105 (11\%) REPORTED DIFFICULTY DISCONTINUING LARC METHODS. ONE-THIRD OF RESPONDENTS EXPERIENCED ONE OR MORE SDH, NOTABLY FOOD INSECURITY (26\%) OR TRANSPORTATION BARRIERS (30\%).

THE ANALYSIS CONTROLLED FOR URBANICITY, INCOME INEQUALITY, MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME, RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION, AND SOUTHERN REGION, AS WELL AS A FIXED EFFECT FOR STATE LEVEL DIFFERENCES.RESULTSFINDINGS SHOW THAT COUNTIES WITH HIGHER RATES OF INCARCERATION HAVE HIGHER PREVALENCE OF INFANT MORTALITY AND LOW BIRTHWEIGHT, AS WELL AS GREATER BLACK-WHITE DISPARITY IN INFANT MORTALITY. MASS INCARCERATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASES IN ADVERSE BIRTH OUTCOMES AND MATERNAL VULNERABILITY PARTIALLY MEDIATES THIS RELATIONSHIP.CONCLUSIONSFINDINGS PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT HEIGHTENED LEVELS OF INCARCERATION AFFECT BIRTH OUTCOMES FOR ALL RESIDENTS AT THE COUNTY-LEVEL. IT IS IMPERATIVE TO ADDRESS THE OVERUSE OF MASS INCARCERATION IN ORDER TO SUPPORT ADEQUATE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE OF VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES. PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS FOUND A NEGATIVE REALTIONSHIP EXISTS BETWEEN INCARCERATION AND POPULATION HEALTH, BUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH BIRTH OUTCOMES VARY BY INCARCERATION RATE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL ARE UNKNOWN.THIS STUDY ESTIMATES ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN COUNTY-LEVEL RATES OF TOTAL INCARCERATION, JAIL ADMISSION, AND PRISON ADMISSION, ON RATES OF INFANT MORTALITY AND LOW-BIRTHWEIGHT. RESULTS SHOW THAT PREVALENCE OF LOW-BIRTHWEIGHT AND INFANT MORTALITY ARE INCREASED IN U.S. COUNTIES WITH HEIGHTENED INCARCERATION RATES AND THAT THIS REALTIONSHIP IS PARTIALLY MEDIATED BY MATERNAL VULNERABILITY, AN ESTIMATION OF RISK FOR ADVERSE PREGNANCY OUTCOMES FOR WOMEN IN THE AREA. THIS STIDY ALSO FOUND THAT MASS INCARCERATION CONTRIBUTES TO THE WIDENING OF BLACK-WHITE DISPARITIES IN INFANT MORTALITY.";"10.1007/s10995-024-03960-0";"ARTICLE; EARLY ACCESS"

IN DOING SO, THIS NOTE USES THE HISTORY OF EUGENICS AND STATE-SANCTIONED REPRODUCTIVE OPPRESSION TO SHOW THAT ABORTION IS NOT ``A TOOL OF MODERN-DAY EUGENICS,'' AS CONSERVATIVES INACCURATELY PROCLAIM.

IN THIS POST-ROE POLITICAL CLIMATE, ACTIVISTS, POLICY MAKERS, VOTERS, AND EVERYDAY INDIVIDUALS ARE RESPONDING TO THE LOSS OF LEGAL AUTHORITY OVER ONE'S BODY. THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES FERTILITY AWARENESS METHODS, CONTRACEPTIVE PRACTICES ALSO KNOWN AS ``NATURAL FAMILY PLANNING.'' I EXPLORE THE FEMINIST HEALTH HISTORY OF FERTILITY AWARENESS METHODS TO ENHANCE BODY KNOWLEDGE AND HOW THESE METHODS DIFFER FROM THE CATHOLIC CHURCH'S ANTIABORTION POSITION PROMOTING NATURAL FAMILY PLANNING. THIS STUDY IS BASED ON MATERIALS COLLECTED FROM THE 1960S TO THE PRESENT ON FERTILITY AWARENESS METHODS AND NATURAL FAMILY PLANNING FROM FEMINIST, CATHOLIC, AND GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVES. I SELECTED THE 1960S DUE TO THE CONFLUENCE OF SOCIAL CHANGES: THE ORGANIZING OF A FEMINIST HEALTH MOVEMENT, THE MARKETING OF THE CONTRACEPTIVE PILL, AND SHIFTS IN CATHOLIC TEACHINGS. BY CHARTING THE MULTIPLE MEANINGS OF FERTILITY AWARENESS METHODS, I HIGHLIGHT THEIR POTENTIAL AS A FULL-BODY HEALTH STRATEGY THAT CAN WITHSTAND MULTIPLE CHALLENGES TO SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE CARE. IN LINE WITH REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE GOALS, FERTILITY AWARENESS METHODS ASSIST BOTH THOSE WHO ARE TRYING NOT TO CONCEIVE AND THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO CONCEIVE, AND UNLIKE MAINSTREAM CONTRACEPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES, THEY BUILD NETWORKS OF PEOPLE PRACTICING FERTILITY AWARENESS. ALTHOUGH FERTILITY AWARENESS METHODS ARE CONTROVERSIAL BECAUSE SOME FEMINIST HEALTH ADVOCATES INTERPRET THEM AS UNDERMINING SUPPORT FOR ALL CONTRACEPTIVES AND ALIGNING WITH AN ANTIABORTION AGENDA, I ADVOCATE FOR A VISIBLE, DYNAMIC, INCLUSIVE FEMINIST FRAMING OF THESE METHODS.";"10.1086/729913";"ARTICLE"

METHODS: WE CONDUCTED SEMI-STRUCTURED TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS WITH 15 WOMEN WHO HAD AN ABORTION BETWEEN JANUARY 2021 AND MARCH 2022 AT A HOSPITAL-BASED CLINIC IN A MID-SIZED MARYLAND CITY. WE PURPOSIVELY RECRUITED PARTICIPANTS WITH VARIED PANDEMIC FINANCIAL IMPACTS. INTERVIEW QUESTIONS PROMPTED PARTICIPANTS TO REFLECT ON HOW THE PANDEMIC AFFECTED THEIR LIVES, PREGNANCY DECISIONS, AND EXPERIENCES SEEKING ABORTION CARE. WE ANALYZED OUR DATA FOR THEMES. RESULTS: ALL PARTICIPANTS HAD SOME INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THEIR ABORTION; OVER HALF PAID USING MEDICAID. MANY PARTICIPANTS EXPERIENCED PANDEMIC FINANCIAL HARDSHIP, WITH SEVERAL REPORTING JOB, FOOD, AND HOUSING INSECURITY AS CIRCUMSTANCES INFLUENCING THEIR DECISION TO HAVE AN ABORTION. MOST WOMEN WHO SELF-REPORTED MINIMAL FINANCIAL HARDSHIP CAUSED BY THE PANDEMIC INDICATED THEY SOUGHT AN ABORTION FOR REASONS UNRELATED TO COVID-19. IN CONTRAST, WOMEN WITH ECONOMIC HARDSHIP VIEWED THEIR PREGNANCIES AS UNSUPPORTABLE DUE TO COVID-19 EXACERBATING FINANCIAL INSTABILITY, EVEN WHEN THEY DESIRED TO CONTINUE THE PREGNANCY. ALL PARTICIPANTS EXPRESSED THAT HAVING AN ABORTION WAS THE BEST DECISION FOR THEIR LIVES.

THE EXISTING SCHOLARSHIP ON THE EVENT READS IT AS ONE THAT WAS MOTIVATED PURELY BY A DEVELOPMENTALIST VISION OF A MODERNIZING POSTCOLONIAL ELITE, TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LATTER REGARDED INCREASES IN HUMAN NUMBERS AS HINDRANCE TO ECONOMIC GROWTH AND IDENTIFIED ABORTION-LEGALIZATION AS A KEY SOLUTION TO THIS QUANDARY. WHILE MERITED, SUCH INTERPRETATIONS DO NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE VARIED TECHNIQUES OF PERSUASION MOBILIZED BY THE PARLIAMENTARIANS/ LAWMAKERS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEBATING THE LAWS. WITH THE HELP OF EXTENSIVE ARCHIVAL ANALYSIS OF THE PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES, THE PAPER SHOWS HOW THE MODES OF REASONING PUT FORTH IN THESE DEBATES WERE NOT ALWAYS PEGGED TO A DEVELOPMENTALIST PARADIGM BUT RATHER MADE UNEQUIVOCAL USE OF A HETEROGENEOUS IDIOM OF ``COMPASSION'' FOR THE WOMAN, VICTIMIZED BY MALE IRRESPONSIBILITY, TO GROUND ITS CASE. THE LAWMAKERS' MOBILIZATION OF THIS CONCEPT FURTHER RECOGNIZED THAT THE VICTIMIZED PREGNANT WOMAN'S STANDPOINT IS EPISTEMICALLY INACCESSIBLE/ INCOMMENSURABLE TO THOSE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ADJUDICATING ON THE ACT OF ABORTION. AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THIS INCOMMENSURABILITY BETWEEN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE TWO PARTIES HOLD, BECAME THE FOUNDATION FOR COMPASSION. IN THE PROCESS OF ELUCIDATING THE USE OF THE IDIOM OF COMPASSION BROACHED IN THESE PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES, THE PAPER BROADENS OUR INTERPRETATIONS OF GLOBAL HISTORIES OF WELFARE FEMINISM IN GENERAL AND REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE IN PARTICULAR.";"10.1080/02759527.2024.2340287";"ARTICLE; EARLY ACCESS"

CHOICES OFFERED WITHIN A NEOLIBERAL MARKET LOGIC FAIL TO UNDERSTAND THE POLITICAL RELATIONALITIES OF SUCH CHOICES. DRAWING ON MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF AN ABORTION AND OTHER EXAMPLES FROM THE FIRST YEAR OF COVID-19, THIS ESSAY DEMONSTRATES HOW LITTLE CHOICE THERE IS IN MATTERS OF CARE; CARE CONNECTS AND DISCONNECTS ONE ANOTHER REGARDLESS OF PERSONAL CHOICES. IF MATTERS OF CARE PERSIST IN THE REALM OF THE MARKET RELIANT ON RATIONAL ECONOMIC AUTONOMOUS ACTORS, THEN THE MANY INTERRELATIONALITIES OF CARE THAT THE PANDEMIC EXPOSED WILL NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON ATTAINING A MORE CARING SOCIETY. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT GIVEN THE NATURE OF ABORTION POLITICS IN THE UNITED STATES.

TEN IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH WOMEN WHO HAD EXPERIENCE OF USING HORMONAL CONTRACEPTION. POLITICAL NARRATIVE ANALYSIS ILLUMINATED HOW THESE WOMEN MOVED NARRATIVELY BOTH CHRONOLOGICALLY, FROM THE TEENAGE YEARS TO ADULTHOOD, AND THROUGH SOCIAL POSITIONING, IN THEIR CONTRACEPTIVE STORIES. TWO DIFFERENT, OFTEN CONFLICTING, DISCOURSES OF HORMONAL CONTRACEPTIVES EMERGED, WHICH THE WOMEN CONSTANTLY NEGOTIATED. THESE CAN BE DESCRIBED AS (1) A BIOMEDICAL INTERPRETATIVE PREROGATIVE, PROMOTING HORMONAL METHODS AS AN EASY FIT FOR EVERYONE, AND NEGATING THE DIVERSE LIVED EXPERIENCES OF WOMEN, AND (2) A SIMPLIFIED CRITICAL MEDIA AND ONLINE DISCOURSE, PAINTING HORMONAL METHODS AS AN ENEMY TO FEMALE HEALTH. FROM A REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE STANDPOINT, THESE STORIES ILLUMINATE THAT AGE IS A RELEVANT INTERSECTIONAL LOCATION, AND EVEN PRIVILEGED WOMEN IN A COUNTRY KNOWN FOR ITS `GENDER EQUALITY AGENDA' CAN EXPERIENCE SUBTLE YET VERY REAL, REPRODUCTIVE COERCION, WHEN AGENCY BECOMES CONSTRAINED TO CHOOSING HORMONAL CONTRACEPTIVES WITHIN A DOMINANT BIOMEDICAL SCRIPT.

USING A THEMATIC ANALYSIS, WE ANALYZED EXPERIENCES RELATED TO MENARCHE AND MENSTRUATION AND THEIR SIGNIFICANCE FOR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH, THE PREPARATION FOR THE PHASE OF MENARCHE AND INTERGENERATIONAL SUPPORT.RESULTSTHE ROMA WOMEN INTERVIEWED SHARED THEIR APPROACH TO THE EXPERIENCES OF MENARCHE AND MENSTRUATION AS CHILDREN IN THEIR FAMILY ENVIRONMENTS WITH A FOCUS ON ACCESS TO INFORMATION PROVIDED BY OTHER WOMEN IN THE FAMILY AND COMMUNITY FOR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH MANAGEMENT. IN THEIR DISCOURSES WE OBSERVED THAT THE ONSET OF MENSTRUATION SUPPOSES A RUPTURE IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SPACES OF GIRLS AND WOMEN.CONCLUSIONSTHE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT WOMEN AND GIRLS DO NOT GAIN ACCESS TO INFORMATION THAT CONTRIBUTES TO THEIR REPRODUCTIVE WELLBEING THROUGH THEIR EXPERIENCE OF MENARCHE. ACCESS TO RESOURCES AND SKILLS TO MANAGE BIOLOGICAL CHANGES IN ADOLESCENTS COULD CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCING THE IMPACT OF CULTURAL MYTHS, FALSE IDEAS AND TABOOS THAT PREVENT ADVOCACY AND EMPOWERMENT ON ISSUES OF REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE. THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT THE PUBLIC SPACES SURROUNDING ROMA WOMEN DO NOT PROVIDE THE TOOLS AND RESOURCES TO PROMOTE AND MAINTAIN THEIR WELLBEING AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AFTER THE ONSET OF THIS IMPORTANT TIME. SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH IS NOT ADDRESSED DURING THE TIME OF CHILDHOOD NOR ADOLESCENCE. ROMA WOMEN LACK A FRAMEWORK WITH AN ESTABLISHED DISCOURSE ON REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE, ALONG WITH THE NECESSARY INSTITUTIONAL RESOURCES. PREPARATION FOR AND FOLLOW-UP OF THE ONSET OF MENSTRUATION AMONG ROMA WOMEN COULD BE A KEY FOR THEIR HEALTH. THESE RESULTS COINCIDE WITH QUALITATIVE STUDIES CARRIED OUT IN WOMEN FROM DIFFERENT CULTURAL ORIGINS, IN WHICH MENARCHE AND MENSTRUATION ARE EXPERIENCED AS A TRANSCENDENTAL FACT. IN OTHER CONTEXTS, SIMILAR TO ROMA WOMEN, THIS STAGE IN WOMEN'S HEALTH LACKS RESOURCES AND INFORMATION AND AN ADEQUATE APPROACH FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH, WHICH CONDITIONS THE MENSTRUAL, SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH OF WOMEN ACROSS THEIR LIFESPAN.

THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THEY DEFEND THE CONTINUITY OF CHILDHOOD AMONG THE NEW GENERATION. ROMA WOMEN EXPRESS THAT THEY EXPERIENCED MENARCHE AS AN EVENT THAT WAS TRAUMATIC, EMBARRASSING AND CONFUSING.

ON THE CONTRARY, REPRODUCTIVE INJUSTICE (RI) EXPOSES THE PRESENCE OF RISKS TO THE DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESS DURING PREGNANCY AND EARLY CHILDHOOD. OBJECTIVE: TO DESCRIBE THE EVOLUTION OF A SET OF INDICATORS RELATED TO REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE IN THE INTEGRATED NATIONAL HEALTH SYSTEM (SNIS) OF URUGUAY OVER LAST 12 YEARS AND COMPARE TRENDS BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SUBSECTORS. METHODOLOGY: A DESCRIPTIVE, RETROSPECTIVE STUDY OF SET OF INDICATORS INCLUDED IN THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS) AND NATIONAL HEALTH OBJECTIVES WAS CONDUCTED. MATERNAL MORTALITY RATIO (MMR), INCIDENCE OF PRETERM BIRTH (PTB), LOW BIRTH WEIGHT (LBW), CONGENITAL SYPHILIS (CS) WERE ANALYZED IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SUBSECTORS OF THE SNIS OVER THE PAST YEARS. RESULTS: DURING THE ANALYZED PERIOD THE MATERNAL MORTALITY RATIO HAS ALWAYS BEEN HIGHER IN THE PUBLIC SUBSECTOR, EXCEPT IN THE YEAR 2015. THE INCIDENCE OF PRETERM BIRTH DURING THE PERIOD HAS RANGED BETWEEN 8.6\% AND 10\%. IT IS HIGHER IN THE PUBLIC SUBSECTOR, EXCEPT SOME PERIODS WHERE IT IS HIGHER IN THE PRIVATE SUBSECTOR. THE INCIDENCE OF LOW BIRTH WEIGHT IS ALWAYS HIGHER THE PUBLIC SUBSECTOR, WITH ITS HIGHEST INCIDENCE IN 2022 AT 9.3. CONGENITAL SYPHILIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN HIGHER THE PUBLIC SUBSECTOR, RANGING FROM 1.3 TO 7.1, WHILE IN THE PRIVATE SUBSECTOR, THE VALUES RANGE FROM 0.2 TO 0.6. CONCLUSIONS: THE DIFFERENCE IN THESE PERINATAL HEALTH INDICATORS BETWEEN THE TWO HEALTHCARE SUBSECTORS IN OUR COUNTRY REFLECTS THAT DESPITE HAVING AN INTEGRATED NATIONAL HEALTH SYSTEM, THERE IS A DISPARITY THAT IMPACTS THE RESULTS OF FINAL AND INTERMEDIATE INDICATORS, THUS DETERMINING THE EXISTENCE OF REPRODUCTIVE INJUSTICE.";"10.29193/RMU.40.2.1";"ARTICLE"

THIS STUDY IS THE FIRST TO EMPIRICALLY INVESTIGATE FERTILITY DECISIONS AND THE QUANTITY-QUALITY TRADE-OFF THEORY FROM A PREFERENCES PERSPECTIVE. FOR THIS PURPOSE, WE USE A NOVEL DISCRETE CHOICE EXPERIMENTAL METHOD, INCLUDING THREE QUALITY AND ONE QUANTITY ASPECT OF CHILD-RAISING, AND THREE SOCIO-ECONOMIC DRIVERS OF FERTILITY. THE CHOICE EXPERIMENT WAS EXECUTED WITH 1000 MEN AND WOMEN IN RURAL SENEGAL AND RURAL UGANDA. WE SHOW THAT RURAL HOUSEHOLDS PREFER TO HAVE MANY CHILDREN, BUT WOMEN AND NON-POOR RESPONDENTS DEMONSTRATE A LOWER PREFERENCE FOR MANY CHILDREN THAN MEN AND POOR RESPONDENTS. WE FIND THAT THE QUANTITY-QUALITY TRADE-OFF IS A TWO-SIDED STORY. ON THE ONE HAND, FOR MOST OF THE QUALITY ATTRIBUTES, WE CONFIRM THE EXISTENCE OF A TRADE-OFF. ON THE OTHER HAND, QUANTITY AND QUALITY ARE COMPLEMENTARY WHEN ALL CHILDREN IN THE HOUSEHOLD CAN ATTAIN A LOWER SECONDARY SCHOOL DIPLOMA. OUR RESULTS IMPLY THAT IMPROVING LIVING CONDITIONS AND ACCESS TO INFRASTRUCTURE IN RURAL AREAS MAY EMPOWER PEOPLE TO MAKE DECISIONS LEADING TO A LOWER FERTILITY. ALIGNING FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAMS WITH REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE REQUIRES A SHIFT IN FOCUS FROM REPRODUCTIVE CONTROL, BASED ON MERE EXPANSION OF CONTRACEPTIVE USE, TO REPRODUCTIVE EMPOWERMENT, BASED ON PREFERENCE-BASED FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAMS.

WE USED A DESIGN-BASED DOUBLY ROBUST ESTIMATE. FIRST, WE USED PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING (1:1) TO IDENTIFY A SUBSAMPLE EQUALLY LIKELY TO COME FROM A DESIRED VS. UNINTENDED PREGNANCY BASED ON GEOGRAPHIC AREA, HOUSEHOLD INCOME, PATERNAL INTENDEDNESS, THE MOTHER'S CURRENT MARITAL STATUS, AGE, ETHNICITY, AND EDUCATIONAL LEVEL, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, AND THE CHILD'S GENDER AND AGE. THEN, WE USED A LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL TO EXPLORE THE RELATION OF MATERNAL PREGNANCY INTENTIONS WITH ADEQUATE DEVELOPMENT, AS DEFINED BY THE EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT INDEX (ECDI). WHILE EXEMPT FROM REVIEW BY AN INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD, THIS SECONDARY RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED IN ACCORD WITH PREVAILING ETHICAL PRINCIPLES.RESULTSAMONG 1694 OBSERVATIONS REPRESENTING 162,285 ECUADORIAN CHILDREN, UNINTENDED PREGNANCY ASSOCIATED WITH INADEQUATE DEVELOPMENT (ODDS RATIO: 1.56; 95\% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL: 1.06; 2.29), AFTER ADJUSTING FOR ALL RELEVANT CONFOUNDERS. UNINTENDED PREGNANCY WAS ALSO NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH ALL FOUR ECDI DOMAINS, SOCIO-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT BEING THE MOST AFFECTED.DISCUSSIONOUR DOUBLY ROBUST DESIGN FOUND EVIDENCE OF THE RELATION BETWEEN THE MATERNAL PERCEPTION OF PREGNANCY AND EARLY CHILD DEVELOPMENT.

ESSENTIAL TO THIS FRAMEWORK IS THE RECOGNITION THAT SINGLE WOMEN EQUALLY DESERVE REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. ALTHOUGH CHINESE LEGISLATION REFRAINS FROM OVERTLY DISALLOWING REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS FOR SINGLE WOMEN, THE INTERPLAY OF CONVENTIONAL MARRIAGE NORMS AND FAMILY PLANNING POLICIES HAS INADVERTENTLY TIED THESE RIGHTS TO MARITAL STATUS, CONSEQUENTLY CONSTRAINING SINGLE WOMEN'S ABILITY TO ASSERT THEM. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A ROBUST LEGAL STRUCTURE TO ENSURE REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS FOR SINGLE WOMEN WOULD PROFOUNDLY CONTRIBUTE TO ADVANCING A HARMONIOUS EVOLUTION OF CHINA'S POPULATION DYNAMICS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: WE EMPLOY METICULOUS TEXTUAL SCRUTINY TO ANALYZE COMPREHENSIVELY THE STIPULATIONS CONCERNING WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE LIBERTIES WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF CHINESE JURISPRUDENCE. FURTHERMORE, WE ENGAGE IN EMPIRICAL INQUIRY TO ENUMERATE AND ELUCIDATE THE MULTIFARIOUS CONSTRAINTS PLACED UPON THE REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOMS OF UNMARRIED WOMEN IN THE CHINESE CONTEXT. THIS ENDEAVOR ENTAILS A DETAILED EXPOSITION AND INCISIVE EXAMINATION OF CHINA'S LIMITATIONS IMPOSED UPON THE REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS OF SINGLE WOMEN, ENCOMPASSING BOTH LEGAL STRICTURES AND POLICY DIMENSIONS. RESULTS: THE ABSENCE OF LEGAL ENDORSEMENT AND SAFEGUARDING HAS GIVEN RISE TO SUBSTANTIAL IMPEDIMENTS TO THE EXERCISE OF REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AMONG SINGLE WOMEN IN CHINA. NOT ONLY DO ENDEAVORS TO ASSERT REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS ON BEHALF OF SINGLE WOMEN ENCOUNTER INTRICATE CHALLENGES IN JUDICIAL IMPLEMENTATION, BUT THEY ALSO ENCOUNTER MANIFOLD BARRIERS WITHIN NATIONAL POLICIES. THIS PREDICAMENT NOT ONLY SUBJECTS SINGLE WOMEN TO CONSIDERABLE PSYCHOLOGICAL STRAIN BUT ALSO CONTRADICTS THE OVERARCHING OBJECTIVE OF ACHIEVING A HARMONIZED POPULATION DEVELOPMENT TRAJECTORY IN CHINA. CONCLUSION: CHINA SHOULD EXPEDITE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR PROTECTING REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS THAT INCLUDES PROVISIONS FOR SUPPORTING SINGLE WOMEN TO HAVE CHILDREN.

(THIS PERSPECTIVE WAS WRITTEN BEFORE THE US SUPREME COURT'S OFFICIAL DECISION TO UPHOLD DOBBS V JACKSON WOMEN'S HEALTH ORGANIZATION, MAKING THE PROCEDURE ILLEGAL IN MORE THAN 20 STATES.) WHILE SOME MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS HAVE DEEPLY HELD BELIEFS AROUND ABORTION, MANY ARE AMBIVALENT OR AGNOSTIC, BELIEVING THAT THE ISSUE DOES NOT AFFECT THEIR SPECIALTIES OR PATIENTS. THE AUTHORS CONTEND THAT CONTINUING TO ENSURE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO SAFE ABORTION IS RELEVANT TO ALL SPECIALTIES AND THEIR PATIENTS, FAMILY MEMBERS, AND COMMUNITIES. THE AUTHORS WRITE THAT SAFE, AFFORDABLE, AND ACCESSIBLE ABORTION SERVICES ARE CRITICAL TO REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE. LIMITING ABORTION RESOURCES UNDERMINES BODILY AUTONOMY AND CONTRIBUTES TO UNINTENDED PREGNANCY. THEY WRITE THAT LAWS THAT RESTRICT ABORTION ACCESS THROUGH ARBITRARY GESTATIONAL-AGE CUTOFFS OR BURDENSOME WAITING PERIODS NARROW THE OPTIONS FOR POPULATIONS THAT ALREADY HAVE POOR ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND EXACERBATE REPRODUCTIVE INEQUITIES BASED ON RACE, ETHNIC GROUP, AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS. THE AUTHORS ASSERT THAT THE ARGUMENTS MADE BY MISSISSIPPI'S SOLICITOR GENERAL IN THE DOBBS CASE TO BAN NEARLY ALL ABORTIONS AFTER 15 WEEKS OF GESTATION SHOW A LACK OF EMPATHY FOR THOSE CONSIDERING THE OPTION OF ABORTION AND A LACK OF TRUST IN INDIVIDUALS TO MAKE FUNDAMENTAL DECISIONS ON WHETHER TO HAVE A CHILD. THE STATE ARGUED THAT THE BURDEN OF PARENTING COULD BE MITIGATED BY ADOPTION AND BABY SAFE HAVENS. THE AUTHORS BELIEVE THAT THIS ARGUMENT DISREGARDS THE SOCIAL, EMOTIONAL, AND ECONOMIC IMPACT ASSOCIATED WITH PREGNANCY, GIVING BIRTH, AND SURRENDERING A CHILD. THE ARGUMENT ALSO PERPETUATES DISINFORMATION THAT ABORTION CARRIES A MEDICAL RISK EQUAL TO THAT OF PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH, WHEREAS MORTALITY DUE TO CHILDBIRTH IN THE UNITED STATES IS 14 TIMES AS HIGH AS THE MORTALITY RATE DUE TO ABORTION. THE STATE ALSO ARGUED THAT THE AVAILABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY OF CONTRACEPTION HAVE CHANGED THE NEED FOR ABORTION. THE AUTHORS CONTEND THAT THIS ARGUMENT SUGGESTS THAT COST IS A FACTOR IN EXERCISING LEGAL RIGHTS AND DISTRACTS FROM DEEPER CONSIDERATIONS TO PROMOTE REPRODUCTIVE WELL-BEING AT THE STATE OR SOCIETAL LEVEL. THE AUTHORS ALSO WRITE THAT ALL BIRTH CONTROL METHODS HOLD THE RISK OF FAILURE, EVEN WHEN USED CORRECTLY, AND UNDER NO OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES IS IT UNLAWFUL TO PROVIDE TREATMENT WHEN PREVENTIVE-MEDICINE REGIMENS FAIL. THE AUTHORS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MORAL CONSIDERATIONS, SUCH AS FETAL VIABILITY THRESHOLDS, ARE A MORE NUANCED ISSUE. THE AUTHORS BELIEVE THAT THE PRECEDENCE OF ROE TO PROTECT THE RIGHT TO ABORTION UNTIL THE POINT OF FETAL VIABILITY CREATES A BALANCESUPPORTING ABORTION ACCESS WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THIS NUANCE. IT IS NOT A LEGISLATIVE LINE, AND MISSISSIPPI'S THRESHOLD OF 15 WEEKS OF GESTATION DOES NOT CONFER VIABILITY. THE AUTHORS WRITE THAT ``THE GRAVITY OF THIS MOMENT CANNOT BE OVERSTATED: THE ASPIRATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES TO BE AN EQUITABLE AND JUST SOCIETY ARE, IN ALL LIKELIHOOD, ABOUT TO RECEIVE ANOTHER BLOW.''";"10.1097/01.ogx.0000889868.17054.b4";"EDITORIAL MATERIAL"

METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A QUALITATIVE STUDY WITH 60 SEMISTRUCTURED INTERVIEWS AT 3 TEACHING HOSPITALS IN TEXAS WITH PHYSICIANS, NURSES, ADMINISTRATORS AND OTHER STAFFWHO PARTICIPATED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF IMMEDIATE POSTPARTUM LARC. PHYSICIANS SELF-IDENTIFIED AS CHAMPIONS AND IDENTIFIED OTHER CHAMPION PHYSICIANS AND ADMINISTRATORS. TWO RESEARCHERS ANALYZED AND CODED INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTS FOR CONTENT AND THEMES. RESULTS: WE FOUND THAT CHAMPIONS DRAW ON INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND RELATIONSHIPS TO BUILD AWARENESS AND SUPPORT FOR IMMEDIATE POSTPARTUM LARC IMPLEMENTATION. TO OBTAIN BUY-IN, CHAMPIONS NEEDED TO DEMONSTRATE FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY, ENGAGE KEY STAKEHOLDERS FROM MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS, AND OBTAIN NURSE BUY-IN. CHAMPIONS ALSO CREATED BUY-IN BY COMMUNICATING GOALS FOR THE SERVICE THAT FOCUSED ON EXPANDING REPRODUCTIVE AUTONOMY, IMPROVING MATERNAL HEALTH, AND IMPROVING ACCESS TO POSTPARTUM CONTRACEPTION. SOME STAFF, ESPECIALLY NURSES, IDENTIFIED REASONS FOR THE PROGRAM THAT RUN COUNTER TO REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE PRINCIPLES: REDUCING BIRTH RATES, POVERTY, AND/OR UNPLANNED PREGNANCY AMONG YOUNG WOMEN AND HIGH-PARITY WOMEN. RESPONDENTS AT 2 HOSPITALS NOTED THAT NOT ALL WOMEN HAD EQUITABLE ACCESS TO IMMEDIATE POSTPARTUM LARC. CONCLUSION: PHYSICIAN AND NON-PHYSICIAN CHAMPIONS MUST SECURE LONG-TERM SUPPORT ACROSS MULTIPLE HOSPITAL DEPARTMENTS TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT AN IMMEDIATE POSTPARTUM LARC PROGRAM. FOR PROGRAMS TO EQUITABLY SERVE ALL WOMEN IN NEED OF POSTPARTUM CONTRACEPTIVE CARE, CHAMPIONS AND OTHER PROGRAM LEADERS NEED TO IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS ACCESS ISSUES.

ECONOMIC ADVERSITY AND IMPLICIT BIAS DURING CLINICAL ENCOUNTERS MAY LEAD TO PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES THAT PLACE BLACK WOMEN AT HIGHER RISK FOR ADVERSE BIRTH OUTCOMES. THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS DISEASE OF 2019 (COVID-19) FURTHER EXACERBATED THIS RISK, AS SAFETY PROTOCOLS INCREASED SOCIAL ISOLATION IN CLINICAL SETTINGS, THEREBY LIMITING OPPORTUNITIES TO ADVOCATE FOR UNBIASED CARE. TWITTER, 1 OF THE MOST POPULAR SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES, HAS BEEN USED TO STUDY A VARIETY OF ISSUES OF PUBLIC INTEREST, INCLUDING HEALTH CARE. THIS STUDY CONSIDERS WHETHER POSTS ON TWITTER ACCURATELY REFLECT PUBLIC DISCOURSE DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND ARE BEING USED IN INFODEMIOLOGY STUDIES BY PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS.OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMS TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF TWITTER FOR IDENTIFYING PUBLIC DISCOURSE RELATED TO SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND ADVOCACY THAT INFLUENCE MATERNAL HEALTH AMONG BLACK WOMEN ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND TO EXAMINE TRENDS IN SENTIMENT BETWEEN 2019 AND 2020 IN THE CONTEXT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.METHODS: TWEETS WERE COLLECTED FROM MARCH 1 TO JULY 13, 2020, FROM 21 ORGANIZATIONS AND INFLUENCERS AND FROM 4 HASHTAGS THAT FOCUSED ON BLACK MATERNAL HEALTH. ADDITIONALLY, TWEETS FROM THE SAME ORGANIZATIONS AND HASHTAGS WERE COLLECTED FROM THE YEAR PRIOR, FROM MARCH 1 TO JULY 13, 2019. TWINT, A PYTHON PROGRAMMING LIBRARY, WAS USED FOR DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS. WE GATHERED THE TEXT OF APPROXIMATELY 17,000 TWEETS, AS WELL AS ALL PUBLICLY AVAILABLE METADATA. TOPIC MODELING AND K-MEANS CLUSTERING WERE USED TO ANALYZE THE TWEETS.RESULTS: A VARIETY OF TRENDS WERE OBSERVED WHEN COMPARING THE 2020 DATA SET TO THE 2019 DATA SET FROM THE SAME PERIOD. THE PERCENTAGES LISTED FOR EACH TOPIC ARE PROBABILITIES OF THAT TOPIC OCCURRING IN OUR CORPUS. IN OUR TOPIC MODELS, TWEETS ON REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE, MATERNAL MORTALITY CRISES, AND PATIENT CARE INCREASED BY 67.46\% IN 2020 VERSUS 2019.

METHODS: WE UTILIZED A FRAMEWORK OF REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE TO ASSESS AND INTERPRET THE ACCESSIBILITY OF ABORTION PROVIDERS TO COLLEGE STUDENTS BY MAPPING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CENTERS AND NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION, THEN USING THESE DATA TO STATISTICALLY COMPARE RACIAL DEMOGRAPHICS, FEMALE EMPLOYMENT, AND INSURANCE COVERAGE BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS WITH AND WITHOUT ACCESS. RESULTS: OF NONPROFIT POSTSECONDARY INSTITUTIONS IN COLORADO, 11 INSTITUTIONS LACK ACCESS, SERVING SIMILAR TO 38,900 STUDENTS. OF THESE STUDENTS, 88.7\% ATTEND A MINORITY SERVING INSTITUTION (MSI). MS'S LACKING ABORTION ACCESS HAD 8\% MORE FEMALE ENROLLMENT [T(18.32)= -2.04, P=0.027]. CAMPUSES POSSESSING STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS ARE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE AN MSI DESIGNATION (50\% WITH VS. 82\% WITHOUT), HAVE GREATER FEMALE HISPANIC ENROLLMENT BY 10\% [T(23.72)=3.11, P= 0.005] AND LOWER FEMALE MULTIRACIAL ENROLLMENT BY 2\% [T(37.00)=2.20, P= 0.034]. ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA) RESULTS INDICATED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN PERCENT COMPOSITION OF ASIAN, BLACK OR AFRICAN AMERICAN, TWO OR MORE, AND NONRESIDENT DEMOGRAPHICS BETWEEN COLLEGIATE CAMPUSES WITH 30-, 45-, AND 60-MINUTE DRIVE-TIME ACCESS. ANOVA RESULTS INDICATED SEPARATE PATTERNS OF DIFFERENCES FOR ZIP CODE TABULATION AREA (ZCTA) DEMOGRAPHICS FOR ASIAN, BLACK OR AFRICAN AMERICAN, NATIVE HAWAIIAN OR PACIFIC ISLANDER, OTHER RACE, AND NONRESIDENT POPULATIONS. PLANNED CONTRASTS DEMONSTRATED THAT THIS DIFFERENCE WAS GREATEST AT THE 30-MINUTE DRIVE-TIME ACCESS, SUPPORTING THE USE OF 30-MINUTE DRIVE TIME AS AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF ACCESS. CONCLUSIONS: THE COLLEGES LACKING ACCESS TO A PROVIDER ARE PREDOMINANTLY MSIS IN LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES.

HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE SPECIFIC NATURE, TYPE, AND IMPACT OF REPRODUCTIVE VIOLENCE ON WOMEN WITH DISABILITIES. THIS SCOPING REVIEW EXAMINED THE LITERATURE RELATED TO THE REPRODUCTIVE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN WITH DISABILITIES. WE USED ARKSEY AND O MALLEY S FRAMEWORK, AND BASED ON OUR INCLUSION CRITERIA, 28 EMPIRICAL ARTICLES WERE INCLUDED. MOST STUDIES WERE PUBLISHED IN THE DISCIPLINES OF HEALTH (I.E., NURSING AND MEDICINE) WITHIN THE NORTH AMERICAN CONTEXT AND USED QUALITATIVE RESEARCH DESIGNS. MAIN FINDINGS WITHIN THE SCOPING REVIEW INCLUDED THEMES RELATED TO IMPOSED CONTRACEPTION, RATIONALIZATION OF STERILIZATION, BARRIERS TO SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES, AND THE DISCOURSES UNDERPINNING REPRODUCTIVE INJUSTICE TOWARD WOMEN WITH DISABILITIES.

THE AUTHOR EMPLOYS THE LENS OF DECOLONIALITY IN AN INTERSECTIONAL MANNER TO UNPACK THE MULTIPLE FORMS OF HIERARCHY AND OPPRESSION THAT THE CONCEPT OF THE NUCLEAR FAMILY HAS HISTORICALLY WORKED TO NATURALIZE IN THE INTERESTS OF CAPITALISM, CHRISTO-NORMATIVITY, AND A WORLD SYSTEM DOMINATED AND CONTROLLED BY THE GLOBAL NORTH.

PRIOR RESEARCH HAS IDENTIFIED A DISTINCT FORM OF DISCRIMINATION, GENDERED RACISM IN PREGNANCY (GRIP), THAT LIKELY ELEVATES STRESS AND IS SUSPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE TO RACIAL DISPARITIES IN BIRTH OUTCOMES AMONG AMERICAN WOMEN. WE INVESTIGATED ASSOCIATIONS OF GRIP EXPERIENCES AND DISTRESS WITH TWO TYPES OF STRESS, PREGNANCY RELATED AND PANDEMIC RELATED, AMONG 2,995 PREGNANT WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES AT THE HEIGHT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, A TIME WHEN HEALTH CARE RESTRICTIONS, SOCIAL CONTACT LIMITATIONS, AND CONCERNS ABOUT COVID-19 INFECTION CREATED ADDED STRESS FOR PREGNANT WOMEN. USING DATA COLLECTED ONLINE DURING THE SECOND US PANDEMIC SURGE (DECEMBER 2020), WE FOUND THAT PREGNANT SELF-IDENTIFIED HISPANIC/LATINA (N = 233), NON-HISPANIC/LATINA BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN (N = 182), AND MULTIRACIAL/OTHER (N = 201) WOMEN EXPERIENCED GREATER GRIP AND GREATER STRESS OF BOTH TYPES THAN NON-HISPANIC/ LATINA WHITE WOMEN. STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING INDICATED A STRONG ASSOCIATION OF RACIAL/ETHNIC IDENTITY WITH PRENATAL STRESS THAT WAS MEDIATED BY GRIP, INDEPENDENT OF OTHER CONTRIBUTORS TO PRENATAL STRESS. FOCUSING ON THE HARMFUL IMPACT OF GENDERED RACISM COUPLED WITH CULTURALLY INFORMED INDIVIDUAL INTERVENTIONS AND CHANGE AT MULTIPLE SOCIETAL LEVELS AND INSTITUTIONS MAY HELP REDUCE THE POORER REPRODUCTIVE OUTCOMES THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY COMMON AMONG COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN THE UNITED STATES.

IT BEGINS BY BRINGING INTO CONVERSATION BLACK MARXIST THEORIES OF RACIAL CAPITALISM AND MARXIST FEMINIST THEORIES OF SOCIAL AND BIOLOGICAL REPRODUCTION PROFFERED BY CEDRIC ROBINSON AND SILVIA FEDERICI RESPECTIVELY. IT DEMONSTRATES THAT SINCE ITS INCEPTION, RACIAL CAPITALISM HAS DEPENDED ON PROCESSES OF RACIALIZED (RE)PRODUCTIVE ACCUMULATION THAT ARE ONGOING BUT NOT YET FULLY THEORIZED. AT THE CENTER OF THE ESSAY IS A CLOSE READING OF HORTENSE SPILLERS’S 1987 CONTRIBUTION “MAMA’S BABY, PAPA’S MAYBE: AN AMERICAN GRAMMAR BOOK.” THOUGH SPILLERS IS NOT GENERALLY REGARDED AS EITHER A BLACK MARXIST OR A MARXIST FEMINIST, THE ESSAY ARGUES THAT SHE OUGHT TO BE RECOGNIZED AS A THEORIST OF RACIALIZED (RE)PRODUCTIVE ACCUMULATION—A PROCESS THAT BEGINS ABOARD THE SLAVE SHIP, PERSISTS ON THE PLANTATION, AND ENDURES INTO THE PRESENT. RACIALIZED (RE)PRODUCTIVE ACCUMULATION EXPLOITED SHE WHOM SPILLERS OFTEN DENOTES AS “THE CAPTIVE FEMALE,” AND, ALSO, PARADOXICALLY, UNGENDERED HER. ULTIMATELY, THROUGH EXAMINATION OF THE PROCESS OF UNGENDERING IN ATLANTIC SLAVERY, THE ESSAY SUGGESTS THAT SPILLERS OPENS UP NEW WAYS TO THINK ABOUT THE HISTORY OF RACIAL CAPITALISM, (RE)PRODUCTIVE DISPOSSESSION, AND THE POSSIBILITY OF ITS REFUSAL.

STRUCTURALLY EMBEDDED POWER HIERARCHIES CONSTITUTE A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN IN ACHIEVING HEALTH FOR ALL AND DEMAND TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE. ADOPTING INTERSECTIONAL FEMINIST APPROACHES POTENTIALLY MITIGATES HEALTH INEQUITIES THROUGH MORE INCLUSIVE AND RESPONSIVE HEALTH POLICIES. WHILE FEMINIST APPROACHES TO FOREIGN AND DEVELOPMENT POLICIES ARE RECEIVING INCREASING ATTENTION, THEY ARE NOT ACCORDED THE IMPORTANCE THEY DESERVE IN GLOBAL HEALTH POLICY. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A FRAMEWORK FOR A FEMINIST GLOBAL HEALTH POLICY (FGHP), OUTLINES THE OBJECTIVES AND UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES AND IDENTIFIES THE ACTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS MEANINGFUL IMPLEMENTATION. RECOGNISING THAT POWER HIERARCHIES AND SOCIETAL CONTEXTS INHERENTLY SHAPE RESEARCH, THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK WAS DEVELOPED VIA A PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH APPROACH THAT ALIGNS WITH FEMINIST PRINCIPLES. THREE INDEPENDENT ONLINE FOCUS GROUPS WERE CONDUCTED BETWEEN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER 2022 WITH 11 PARTICIPANTS AFFILIATED TO THE GLOBAL-ACADEMIC OR LOCAL-ACTIVIST LEVEL AND COVERING ALL WHO REGIONS. THE QUALITATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT A FGHP MUST BE CENTRED ON CONSIDERATIONS OF INTERSECTIONALITY, POWER AND KNOWLEDGE PARADIGMS TO PRESENT MEANINGFUL ALTERNATIVES TO THE CURRENT STRUCTURES. BY BALANCING GUIDING PRINCIPLES WITH SENSITIVITY FOR CONTEXT-SPECIFIC ADAPTATIONS, THE FRAMEWORK IS DESIGNED TO BE APPLICABLE LOCALLY AND GLOBALLY, WHILST ITS ADOPTION IS INTENDED TO ADVANCE HEALTH EQUITY AND REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE, WITH COMMUNITIES AND POLICYMAKERS IDENTIFIED AS THE MAIN ACTORS. THIS STUDY UNDERSCORES THE IMPORTANCE OF DISMANTLING POWER STRUCTURES BY FOSTERING INTERSECTIONAL AND PARTICIPATORY APPROACHES FOR A MORE EQUITABLE GLOBAL HEALTH LANDSCAPE.

THOUGH QUALITATIVE STUDIES OF NON-INCARCERATED PREGNANT AND NON-PREGNANT INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS WITH OUD DEMONSTRATE COMPLEXITIES THAT MUST BE CONSIDERED IN DELIVERING EFFECTIVE CARE, STUDIES WITH PREGNANT, INCARCERATED PATIENTS WITH OUD ARE LACKING. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED SEMI-STRUCTURED QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS FROM OCTOBER 2020–NOVEMBER 2021 WITH PREGNANT AND POSTPARTUM PEOPLE WITH OUD WHO WERE CURRENTLY OR PREVIOUSLY IN JAIL IN FLORIDA, MARYLAND, OHIO, AND VIRGINIA. INTERVIEW GUIDES INCORPORATED UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE POWER DYNAMICS OF INCARCERATION AND GENDERED EXPECTATIONS OF MOTHERHOOD. WE ANALYZED TRANSCRIPTS USING DESCRIPTIVE PHENOMENOLOGY TO IDENTIFY THEMES AROUND EXPERIENCES OF TREATMENT OR WITHDRAWAL IN JAIL AND UPON RELEASE. RESULTS: WE INTERVIEWED 32 WOMEN, 23 PREGNANT AND NINE POSTPARTUM. SOME RECEIVED MOUD IN JAIL AND OTHERS ENDURED WITHDRAWAL. ALL PARTICIPANTS EXPRESSED CONCERN FOR THEIR BABIES. FIVE THEMES EMERGED: 1)LACK OF COUNSELING OR ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT MOUD IN PREGNANCY; 2)ABSENT, DELAYED, OR COERCIVE CARE IN JAIL; 3)EXPERIENCES OF STIGMA AND DISCRIMINATION FROM STAFF AND CAREGIVERS; 4)STRUCTURAL BARRIERS TO SAFE TRANSITIONS AND CONTINUING MOUD; AND 5)THE DESTRUCTIVE PRESENCE OF CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES FOR CARE CONTINUITY.

OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO BEGIN A MULTI-PHASED, RIGOROUS EVALUATION TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT AND OUTCOMES OF THE WORK OF CERCL-FP. STUDY DESIGN: A NEEDS ASSESSMENT WITH FORMER GRADUATES AND CURRENT DIRECTORS OF FELLOWSHIPS IN FAMILY PLANNING WAS CONDUCTED USING QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS. THE FOCUS OF THESE INTERVIEWS WAS TO DETERMINE THE ABILITY, READINESS, AND WILLINGNESS OF THE FIELD OF FAMILY PLANNING TO RETROFIT NEW CURRICULA GROUNDED IN EQUITY, RACE, AND CULTURAL LITERACY. RESULTS: NINE (N = 9) INTERVIEWS WERE COMPLETED WITH SEVEN BOARD CERTIFIED OBSTETRICIAN-GYNECOLOGISTS AND TWO BOARD CERTIFIED FAMILY MEDICINE PHYSICIANS. THREE THEMES WERE IDENTIFIED: (1) ESTABLISHING THE DISTRIBUTION OF WORK; (2) THE PUSH/PULL OF CHANGE FROM INSIDE AND OUTSIDE: CURRICULA AND FACULTY RESPONSIBILITIES; AND (3) REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE AND FELLOWSHIPS IN FAMILY PLANNING. DESPITE ACKNOWLEDGING THE NEED TO RETROFIT THE FIELD OF FAMILY PLANNING WITH CONTENT GROUNDED IN EQUITY, RACE, AND CULTURAL LITERACY, THERE ARE STRUCTURAL, INSTITUTIONAL, AND INDIVIDUAL LEVEL BARRIERS THAT HAVE LIMITED THE ADOPTION OF CERCL-FP CURRICULA WITHIN FAMILY PLANNING CURRICULUM NATIONWIDE. CONCLUSION: FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY ILLUMINATE MULTIPLE BARRIERS THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHEN EXPANDING FOUNDATIONAL KNOWLEDGE OF CLINICIANS AND RESEARCHERS. IMPLICATIONS: SIMILAR TO THE SLOW INTEGRATION OF RESEARCH FINDINGS INTO CLINICAL PRACTICE, THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT INTEGRATION OF SOCIAL SCIENCE AND NEW CURRICULA WITHIN THE FIELD OF FAMILY PLANNING FACES SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS.

THE USE OF EGG FREEZING HAS GROWN IN POPULARITY SINCE THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE LIFTED ITS EXPERIMENTAL LABEL IN 2012. HOWEVER, WHILE THE TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY USED FOR NON-MEDICAL REASONS, IT REMAINS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIAL INEQUALITIES IN CONTEMPORARY SOCIETIES. TO UNDERSTAND SUCH IMPLICATIONS OF EGG FREEZING, WE MUST CONSIDER THE WIDER LANDSCAPE OF REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIES AND THE SOCIAL GROUPS AFFECTED BY THEM. ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIES IS STRATIFIED IN TURKEY, WITH SOME SOCIAL GROUPS ABLE TO AFFORD CROSS-BORDER REPRODUCTIVE TRAVEL, AS GAMETE DONATION AND SURROGACY ARE LEGALLY PROHIBITED, AND IVF IS ONLY ALLOWED TO MARRIED COUPLES. THE CHAPTER HIGHLIGHTS INTERSECTIONAL PERSPECTIVES ON REPRODUCTION, INCLUDING CONCEPTS SUCH AS REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE AND STRATIFIED REPRODUCTION, AND DISCUSSES THE TOPIC DRAWING ON THE AUTHOR’S ONGOING RESEARCH ON WOMEN’S EXPERIENCES OF EGG FREEZING IN TURKEY.

BRIMMING WITH FEMINIST EPIPHANIES, THIS SOCIAL JUSTICE PLAYBOOK IS AN URGENT CALL FOR WOMEN’S COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP TO GUIDE HUMANITY THROUGH THE GRAVEST OF CHALLENGES, OVERCOMING PATRIARCHY’S MULTI-MILLENNIUM REIGN THROUGH THE UPRISING OF WOMEN LEADERS AND PHILANTHROPISTS. FOUNDED DURING THE SECOND-WAVE WOMEN’S MOVEMENT OF THE EARLY 1970S, SMALL GROUPS OF WOMEN ACROSS THE WORLD, INDEPENDENT OF EACH OTHER, HAD THE SAME EPIPHANY: IT WILL TAKE A MOVEMENT OF WOMEN TO RAISE THE MONEY NEEDED TO FUND WOMEN’S FREEDOM. SINCE THEN, THE GLOBAL WOMEN’S FUNDING MOVEMENT HAS GROWN INTO A GLOBAL NETWORK OF RADICALLY GENEROUS, RISK-TAKING PHILANTHROPISTS WHO COLLECTIVELY WIELD FINANCIAL MIGHT TO WIN SEISMIC GENDER EQUALITY VICTORIES. THE AUTHORS DOCUMENT THE “WOMEN EFFECT” THAT RESULTS FROM GENDER EQUALITY AND WOMEN’S COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP, INCLUDING IMPROVED PUBLIC HEALTH AND REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE, EXPANDED PUBLIC EDUCATION, STRONGER DEMOCRACIES, RESILIENT ECONOMIES, CLIMATE RECOVERY AND ENDURING PEACE. THE GLOBAL WOMEN’S FUNDING MOVEMENT IS GUIDED BY ITS FEMINIST FUNDING PRINCIPLES AND, THROUGH THEM, IT HAS INNOVATED THE MOST EFFECTIVE PHILANTHROPIC PRACTICES, INCLUDING TRUST-BASED PHILANTHROPY. THE UPRISING OF WOMEN IN PHILANTHROPY IS FOR THOSE INTERESTED IN FOCUSING THE POWER OF PHILANTHROPY ON LEVERAGING SYSTEMIC SOCIAL JUSTICE VICTORIES AND GENDER EQUALITY GAINS. THE LONG-PRACTICED FEMINIST FUNDING PRINCIPLES IMPARTED BY THE AUTHORS IS A RECIPE FOR THE FEMINIST ALCHEMY NEEDED TO TRANSFORM SOCIETY FOR THE BETTERMENT OF ALL. THE UPRISING OF WOMEN IN PHILANTHROPY IS WRITTEN IN A COLLECTIVE VOICE AND IS ALSO, WE BELIEVE, AN IMPORTANT HUMAN RIGHTS DOCUMENT. IT OFFERS A ROADMAP TO ACHIEVE A THRIVING DEMOCRACY. THIS BOOK MARKS THE FIRST TIME THAT WOMEN’S RIGHTS PHILANTHROPISTS HAVE UNITED, IN BOOK FORM AND IN ONE VOICE, TO CALL FOR MASSIVE INVESTMENTS IN WOMEN’S RIGHTS FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE CHANGE.

HOWEVER, THE INFLUENCE OF RACISM ON SEXUAL HEALTH HAS NOT BEEN WELL-DESCRIBED IN QUALITATIVE STUDIES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE DEFINITIONS OF STRUCTURAL RACISM AND DETERMINE HOW EXPERIENCES OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IMPACT SEXUAL HEALTH AND DECISION-MAKING IN A SAMPLE OF ADOLESCENT BLACK GIRLS. METHODS: BLACK GIRLS AGED 13–19 YEARS WERE RECRUITED FROM AN ONGOING LONGITUDINAL STUDY. VIRTUAL FOCUS GROUPS AND INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS WERE FACILITATED, INQUIRING ABOUT UNDERSTANDINGS OF STRUCTURAL RACISM, EXPERIENCES WITH DISCRIMINATION, AND FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE SEXUAL HEALTH DECISION-MAKING AND HEALTHCARE-SEEKING. TRANSCRIPTS WERE PROFESSIONALLY TRANSCRIBED AND CODED BY TWO INDEPENDENT, BLINDED TEAM MEMBERS. THEMATIC CONTENT ANALYSIS WAS USED TO IDENTIFY EMERGENT THEMES. RESULTS: FOUR THEMES EMERGED AS FOLLOWS: (1) SLAVERY AND MEDICAL RACISM IN THE UNITED STATES IMPACT THE SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH (SRH) CHOICES OF BLACK GIRLS; (2) STEREOTYPES AND OVERSEXUALIZATION OF BLACK GIRLS ARE CONSIDERED A BARRIER TO SRH EDUCATION; (3) ADULTS SERVE AS BOTH BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO SRH AND RESOURCE UTILIZATION; AND (4) BLACK GIRLS OFTEN SEEK INFORMATION FROM FRIENDS OR SOCIAL MEDIA OUTLETS TO MAKE SRH DECISIONS. DISCUSSION: REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH EDUCATION FOR BLACK GIRLS SHOULD INTEGRATE HISTORICAL INFLUENCES OF SYSTEMIC OPPRESSION.

WHILE POSTABORTION CARE IS AVAILABLE IN HOSPITALS AROUND THE WORLD, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW THIS GLOBAL MODEL HAS BEEN INTEGRATED INTO DAILY OBSTETRIC CARE IN COUNTRIES WITH RESTRICTIVE ABORTION LAWS. DRAWING ON ETHNOGRAPHIC FIELDWORK IN ARGENTINA AND SENEGAL, WE EXPLORE HOW HEALTH WORKERS HAVE ADAPTED THE GLOBAL POSTABORTION CARE MODEL IN WAYS THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY CHALLENGE AND REINFORCE NATIONAL PROHIBITIONS ON ABORTION. WE USE THE TERM “SUBVERSIVE EPIDEMIOLOGY” TO DESCRIBE HOW HEALTH WORKERS ADJUDICATE BETWEEN ALLEGEDLY LEGITIMATE AND ILLEGITIMATE CASES OF PREGNANCY TERMINATION OR LOSS. IN ARGENTINA, THESE PRACTICES HAVE EXPANDED ACCESS TO SAFE ABORTION IN CERTAIN HEALTH FACILITIES. IN SENEGAL, THESE PRACTICES HAVE REDEFINED POSTABORTION CARE AS AN INTERVENTION FOR THE TREATMENT OF COMPLICATIONS OF MISCARRIAGE. ALTHOUGH THE GLOBAL POSTABORTION CARE MODEL AIMED TO DEPOLITICIZE THE PROBLEM OF UNSAFE ABORTION, WE FIND THAT HEALTH WORKERS’ CLINICAL AND RECORD-KEEPING DECISIONS ARE DECIDEDLY POLITICAL AS THEY CONTRIBUTE TO AN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL RECORD THAT OFTEN DOES MORE TO OBSCURE THAN ELUCIDATE THE INCIDENCE OF ABORTION.

THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK DRAWS UPON A FEMINIST TRAJECTORY OF (GENDERED) BIOPOLITICS, AND EMBODIED PERFORMATIVITY AND REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE ARE KEY CONCEPTS IN THE ANALYSIS.

THE CHAPTER ARGUES THAT THE RIGHT OF A PREGNANT PERSON TO WITHDRAW CONSENT TO CONTINUING AN UNWANTED PREGNANCY NEEDS TO BE UNIVERSALLY PROTECTED FOR EVERYONE CAPABLE OF GESTATION - THIS IS ESSENTIAL FOR REPRODUCTIVE AUTONOMY AND PERSONAL AUTONOMY MORE BROADLY. CONTEXTUALISING REPRODUCTIVE AUTONOMY AS A RIGHT TO WITHDRAW CONSENT IS A STRONGER POSITING THAN AS A PRIVACY RIGHT OR AS A COMPONENT OF THE RIGHT TO HEALTH. THE RESEARCH FINDS THAT INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW FOCUSES ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE INABILITY TO WITHDRAW CONSENT IN TERMS OF RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, BUT WITH RESPECT TO EXTREME CASES. THIS HAS THE CONSEQUENCE OF RESPECTING THE RULE, WHICH IS A BAN ON ABORTION, SUBJECT ONLY TO EXCEPTIONS. TO SHIFT TO UNIVERSALISING A RIGHT TO WITHDRAW CONSENT TO CONTINUING AN UNWANTED PREGNANCY REQUIRES ENGAGING FEMINIST THEORY AND LITERATURE ON REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE, REPRODUCTIVE AUTONOMY, AND RELATIONAL AUTONOMY.

ANALYZING US VITAL STATISTICS DATA FROM THE PERIOD 1989–2019, WE SIMULATED THE EFFECT THAT THE DISTRIBUTIONAL SHIFT TO OLDER MATERNAL AGES AT FIRST BIRTH HAD ON HEALTH INEQUITY BETWEEN BLACK AND WHITE INFANTS. NET OF MATERNAL SOCIOECONOMIC INDICATORS, THIS SHIFT INCREASED THE RELATIVE ODDS THAT WHITE WOMEN GAVE BIRTH TO VERY-LOW-BIRTHWEIGHT (VLBW) INFANTS BY 10 PERCENT, VERSUS 19 PERCENT FOR BLACK WOMEN, LARGELY ACCOUNTING FOR THE RISE IN VLBW AND THE INCREASE IN RACIAL INEQUITY SEEN IN THE YEARS ANALYZED. REDUCTIONS IN INFANT MORTALITY OVER THE PERIOD WERE DAMPENED BY THE MATERNAL AGE SHIFT, ESPECIALLY AMONG BLACK BABIES, EXACERBATING BLACK-WHITE INEQUITY.

HISTORICALLY, THE US SEXUALITY FIELD HAS NOT INCLUDED THE EXPERIENCES AND WISDOM OF RACIALIZED SEXOLOGISTS, EDUCATORS, THERAPISTS, OR PROFESSIONALS. INSTEAD, SEXUALITY PROFESSIONALS HAVE BEEN TRAINED USING A COLOR-FREE NARRATIVE THAT DOES AN INJUSTICE BY EXCLUDING THEIR WORK AS WELL AS FAILING TO OFFER A FULLER EXAMINATION OF HOW THEY HAVE EXPANDED THE FIELD AND HELD IT ACCOUNTABLE. THE RESULT OF THIS WHOLESALE ERASURE IS THAT TODAY MANY SEXUALITY PROFESSIONALS UNDERSTAND THESE CONTRIBUTIONS AS EXTRA OR TANGENTIAL, AND NOT PART OF THE FULL VISION AND HISTORY OF THE FIELD OF SEXOLOGY. HIGHLIGHTING THE VOICES AND EXPERIENCES OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN RACIALIZED AND THUS EXCLUDED, ISOLATED, ERASED, AND YET HAVE STILL EMERGED AS VITAL CONTRIBUTORS TO THE NORTH AMERICAN SEXUALITY FIELD, THIS TEXT OFFERS A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN THE WAY WE LEARN AND UNDERSTAND SEXUALITY, ONE THAT IS EXPANSIVE AND COMMITTED TO LIBERATION, HEALING, EQUITY, AND JUSTICE.

SEEKING TO REDRESS THE GENDEREDBIAS ON BRITISH THEATRE'S DEPICTION OF POPULATION ARGUMENTS, THIS CHAPTER USES FEMINIST SCHOLARSHIP TO ANALYSE THREE PRODUCTIONS BY FEMALE WRITERS AND DIRECTORS THAT DEAL WITH CONCERNS OF POPULATIONISM AND REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE. THE FIRST OF THESE IS MAUD DROMGOOLE'S 3 BILLION SECONDS (2018). THE PRODUCTION IS EXPLORED THROUGH THE CONCEPT OF DEMOPOPULATIONISM, WHICH DICTATES THAT SOME PARTS OF A NATION'S DEMOGRAPHY SHOULD BE COERCED, DISSUADED, OR FORCIBLY PREVENTED FROM REPRODUCTION. 3 BILLION SECONDS IS ARGUED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT SUCH TAXONOMIC-INFORMED LOGIC LEADS TO ACYNICAL DEHUMANISATION OF OTHERS. THE SECOND CASE STUDY IS FLORENCE KEITH-ROACH'S EGGS (2015). USING THE FRAMEWORK OF REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE-WHICH HIGHLIGHTS WHETHER INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE FREE RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO HAVE CHILDREN OR NOT, AND IF THEIR DECISIONS ARE SUPPORTED AND RESPECTED-THE ANALYSIS IS CENTRED ON HOW THE TWO FEMALE PROTAG-ONISTS OF EGGS DO NOT RECEIVE FULL REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE IN THE NEOLIBERAL SOCIETY OF 2010S BRITAIN.

MANY SUPPORTERS DEFEND NIPT ON THE GROUNDS THAT PRENATAL GENETIC INFORMATION HELPS WOULD-BE PARENTS MAKE BETTER FAMILY PLANNING CHOICES. WE CHALLENGE THAT ASSESSMENT BY SHOWING HOW, UNDER THE CURRENT REGIME OF ABLEISM AND NEOLIBERAL REPROGENETICS, NIPT PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTENSIFIED CONTROL OVER WOMEN’S REPRODUCTIVE DECISIONS. FOCUSING INTENTLY ON THE CASE OF DOWN SYNDROME, THE BOOK DEMONSTRATES HOW SEVERAL FACTORS ENSNARE PROSPECTIVE MOTHERS IN A WEB OF TOUGH CHOICES BY STACKING THE DECK AGAINST THE DECISION TO BRING A CHILD WITH A GENETIC IMPAIRMENT INTO THE WORLD AND PARENT HER WITH DIGNITY, INCLUDING: (1) WIDESPREAD ABLEIST ATTITUDES IN MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS; (2) NEOLIBERAL WELFARE POLICIES THAT PRIVATIZE SOCIAL SERVICES AND THE PROVISION OF CARE; AND (3) OPPRESSIVE SOCIAL NORMS, INCLUDING ABLEIST AND SEXIST ATTITUDES. DRAWING ON FEMINIST POLITICAL THEORY AND CRITICAL DISABILITIES SCHOLARSHIP, WE ADVANCE A CONCEPTION OF RELATIONAL AUTONOMY PREMISED ON PERFECTIONIST LIBERAL NOTIONS OF THE STATE AS A VEHICLE FOR INTERSECTIONAL SOCIAL JUSTICE.

IN INTERVIEWS, PARTICIPANTS DESCRIBED HOW AND FROM WHOM THEY LEARNED ABOUT PREGNANCY AND BIRTH, THEIR EXPERIENCES WITH MISCARRIAGE AND COMPLICATIONS DURING PREGNANCY, WORKING DURING PREGNANCY AND LACK OF POST-PARTUM OR MATERNITY LEAVE, AND GENERATIONAL CHANGES IN PREGNANCY. THESE FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT THE IMPACT OF PREVIOUS REPRODUCTIVE EXPERIENCES AND FAMILY SUPPORT DURING PREGNANCY FOR WOMEN FROM THIS TRIBE. THE DATA ALSO DRAWS ATTENTION TO THE IMPORTANCE OF PAID LEAVE IN THE POSTPARTUM PERIOD AND PROVIDES AN EXAMPLE OF COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH METHODS WITH INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES. © (2023). ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. THE CREATION OF A POLITICAL SUBJECT POSITION BASED ON THE IDENTITY ‘LESBIAN MOTHER’ WAS CENTRAL TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF LAW REFORM REGARDING REPRODUCTION AND FAMILY MATTERS IN AUSTRALIA IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY. AUTHORS IDENTIFYING AS LESBIAN MOTHERS WROTE SUBMISSIONS TO A RANGE OF PUBLIC INQUIRIES, CRAFTING DETAILED SELF-REPRESENTATIONS AND OFTEN TELLING INTIMATE STORIES OF EVERYDAY EXPERIENCE OF DISCRIMINATION AND MARGINALISATION. THIS ARTICLE UNDERSTANDS THE SUBMISSIONS AS CONSTRAINED BY THE PRACTICES OF POLITICAL SUBJECTIVITY. THEY ARE GOVERNED BY THE RULES OF THE AUTHORITY TO WHICH SUBMISSIONS ARE ADDRESSED, EVEN AS THEY MAKE CLAIMS FOR CHANGE. INVESTIGATION OF AVAILABLE SUBMISSIONS FROM LESBIAN MOTHERS FROM NINE INQUIRIES POINTS TO THE CLASSED AND RACED LIMITS OF THE NORMATIVE POLITICAL SUBJECT WHICH EMERGES AND TO THE PRESENCE OF HISTORICALLY DOMINANT DISCOURSES OF THE GOOD MOTHER AND THE NARROWED IMAGINATION OF THE MARRIAGE EQUALITY MOVEMENT. DIVERSITY IN THE SUBMISSIONS, HOWEVER, ALSO CHALLENGES THE BOUNDARIES OF THE RULES AND AVOIDS UNIVERSAL CONFORMITY TO RESPECTABILITY. THIS ANALYSIS CONTRIBUTES TO THE SCANT HISTORIOGRAPHY OF LESBIAN MOTHER POLITICS IN AUSTRALIA AND TO THE INTERNATIONAL LITERATURE ON QUEER POLITICS AND SEXUAL CITIZENSHIP.

K.";4;2022;"ANIMATING AND SUSTAINING OUTRAGE: THE PLACE OF CRISIS PREGNANCY CENTERS IN ABORTION JUSTICE";"IN 2021, U.S. STATES ENACTED 106 DIFFERENT ABORTION RESTRICTIONS, THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF ANY YEAR SINCE ROE V. WADE WAS DECIDED IN 1973. INSPIRING THE MOST PUBLIC OUTCRY IS TEXAS'S S.B. 8, WHICH BANS ABORTION AFTER SIX WEEKS AND ALLOWS PRIVATE CITIZENS TO SUE THOSE PERFORMING ABORTIONS OR AIDING IN THIS PROCESS. ABORTION JUSTICE SUPPORTERS SHOULD BE ENRAGED—BUT ONLY IN SMALL PART DUE TO TEXAS’ BAN, ANY OF THE OTHER 105 ENACTED RESTRICTIONS, OR THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE SUPREME COURT SOON WILL HAND DOWN A DECISION TO OVERTURN ROE V. WADE. WE SHOULD BE ENRAGED BECAUSE THE ANTI-ABORTION MOVEMENT HAS CHIPPED AWAY AT THE ACCESSIBILITY OF ABORTION TO THE DEGREE THAT THE LEGAL RIGHT TO ABORTION MEANS FAR LESS THAN IT SHOULD. KEY TO THIS CHIPPING AWAY HAS BEEN CRISIS PREGNANCY CENTERS—RELIGIOUSLY MOTIVATED, ANTI-ABORTION NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT CRITICS DESCRIBE AS “FAKE WOMEN'S HEALTH CLINICS.” TODAY, THERE ARE 2500 CRISIS PREGNANCY CENTERS AND JUST 738 ABORTION CLINICS IN THE U.S., NUMBERS THAT WERE REVERSED 30 YEARS AGO. AND YET, COUNTERING CRISIS PREGNANCY CENTERS HAS BEEN LESS CENTRAL TO THE WORK OF ABORTION JUSTICE ADVOCATES THAN ADVANCING CRISIS PREGNANCY CENTERS HAS BEEN TO THE ANTI-ABORTION MOVEMENT. IN THIS ARTICLE, I ARGUE THAT FOCUSING ON CRISIS PREGNANCY CENTERS CAN PROVIDE NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR BOTH UNDERSTANDING THE CONTEMPORARY ABORTION LANDSCAPE AND ALSO FOR ADVANCING ABORTION JUSTICE ACTIVISM. TO PUT A FINER POINT ON IT, I ARGUE THAT CENTERING CRISIS PREGNANCY CENTERS IN OUR DEVELOPMENT OF WHAT SYDNEY CALKIN TERMS “THE POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY OF ABORTION” IS ONE WAY TO ANIMATE OUTRAGE AMONG THOSE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN INVOLVED IN ABORTION JUSTICE WORK PREVIOUSLY AND TO SUSTAIN OUTRAGE AMONG FEMINIST ACTIVISTS WHO HAVE BEEN WORN DOWN BY DECADES OF ANTI-ABORTION ADVANCEMENT. © THE AUTHOR(S) 2022.";"10.1177/19427786221076154";"ARTICLE"

AGGRAVATING THE SITUATION, DURING THE COVID-19 CRISIS, THE BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT ACCELERATED THE PROCESS OF HOLLOWING OUT THE ACCESS TO CONTRACEPTION AND LEGAL ABORTION SERVICES IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. THIS HAS TAKEN MANY FORMS-THE MOST SERIOUS BEING THE ISSUING OF AN EXECUTIVE MEASURE IMPOSING NEW FORMAL BARRIERS TO ACCESS THE RIGHT TO LEGAL ABORTION (ORDINANCE NO 2282 OF 27 AUGUST 27 2020).

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE THE BIRTH CONTROL ACCESS EXPERIENCES AND BARRIERS AMONG INDIGENOUS WOMEN BELONGING TO A STATE-RECOGNIZED TRIBE IN THE GULF COAST REGION OF THE UNITED STATES. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH A COMMUNITY ADVISORY BOARD, A QUALITATIVE DESCRIPTIVE RESEARCH APPROACH WAS USED TO CONDUCT SEMI-STRUCTURED LIFE COURSE INTERVIEWS WITH 31 INDIGENOUS WOMEN.

BLACK AND BROWN INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES, WHO ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY MASS INCARCERATION AND HEALTH DISPARITIES, ARE MOST IN NEED OF ABOLITIONIST REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE.

THE POOR, OFTEN BEARING THE BRUNT OF MASS UNEMPLOYMENT, NOT ONLY RELY ON A FAILING SYSTEM, BUT RESORT TO PARALLEL SYSTEMS. BUILDING ON THEORETICAL AND POLITICAL STANDPOINTS THAT EMERGE AS FEMINIST SCHOLARS INTERROGATE AND ENGAGE WITH THE BODY, THIS CHAPTER EXPLORES NOTIONS OF REPRODUCTIVE VIOLENCE AND STRATIFIED ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. IT ARGUES THAT SOUTHERN AFRICAN COUNTRIES DOMESTICATE INTERNATIONAL POLICIES GOVERNING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH IN A WAY THAT PERPETUATES REPRODUCTIVE VIOLENCE, DEFINED HERE AS THE INSTITUTIONAL OR STRUCTURAL, PHYSICAL, AND EMOTIONAL VIOLENCE THAT WOMEN SUFFER IN ATTEMPTING TO ACCESS PREGNANCY TERMINATION SERVICES. THROUGH DOMESTICATION, THE INTERNATIONAL POLICIES EMERGE AS ‘SOFT LAW’, NOT BINDING ON GOVERNMENTS. THE WAY POOR MIGRANT AND SOUTH AFRICAN WOMEN ARE LURED BY ILLEGAL ADVERTS TO PUT THEMSELVES AT RISK OF MATERNAL DEATH OR LONGSTANDING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH COMPLICATIONS – IN A COUNTRY CELEBRATED FOR ITS PROGRESSIVE CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION ON TERMINATION – OPENS SPACE FOR CONCEPTUAL AND EMPIRICAL INTERROGATIONS.

CLANDESTINE CHILDHOOD (INFANCIA CLANDESTINA, DIR. BENJAMÍN ÁVILA, 2011) PORTRAYS FROM AN OLDER CHILD’S POINT-OF-VIEW THE THEFT OF HIS BABY SISTER AND DISAPPEARANCE OF HIS PARENTS. THIRD, CAPTIVE (CAUTIVA, DIR. GASTÓN BIRABEN, 2003) REPRESENTS AN ADOLESCENT’S DISORIENTING DISCOVERY THAT SHE HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM HER BIOLOGICAL PARENTS TO BE GIVEN TO ALLIES OF THE REGIME. THESE WIDELY AVAILABLE FILMS SHARE AN EMPATHY WITH THE PARENTS’ LOSS OF A CHILD AND WITH CHILDREN’S LOSS OF BIOLOGICAL PARENTS, AN EMPHASIS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE AND PARENTING, AND A RESISTANCE TO THE DICTATORSHIP’S NARRATIVE OF SILENCE AND FEAR. © THE AUTHOR(S), UNDER EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG 2022.";"10.1007/978-3-030-99530-0_23";"BOOK CHAPTER"

BUTLER IS DEEPLY CONCERNED WITH HOW HIERARCHIES OF POWER MANIFEST NOT ONLY SOCIO-POLITICALLY BUT ALSO INTERPERSONALLY. EVEN RELATIONSHIPS DEFINED BY LOVE, COMMUNITY, INTERCONNECTEDNESS, AND SYMBIOSIS MUST NAVIGATE IMBALANCES IN POWER THAT RESULT IN ATTEMPTS TO SUBJECT AND EXPLOIT THOSE INVOLVED. FOR BUTLER, VARYING RELATIONS OF POWER AND POWERLESSNESS STRUCTURE EVERY SOCIAL DYNAMIC. BUTLER PARTICULARLY EXPLORES THIS THEME AND THESIS THROUGH THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HUMANS AND TECHNOLOGY, REPRODUCING BODIES, CHILDREN, AND OTHER MEDIATING SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ENTITIES AND FORCES.

HOW WOMEN OF COLOR ACTIVISTS ARE REDEFINING THE PRO-CHOICE PARADIGM,” KIMALA PRICE ASSERTS, “WOMEN MUST BE ABLE TO FREELY EXERCISE THESE RIGHTS WITHOUT COERCION. ALTHOUGH REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE ACTIVISTS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AN EMPHASIS ON GAINING LEGAL RIGHTS, LOBBYING, AND ELECTORAL POLITICS IS NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING, THEY ARGUE THAT THERE HAS TO BE AN INTERSECTIONAL ANALYSIS AND THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF OPPRESSION IN ORDER FOR WOMEN TO TRULY GAIN FREEDOM” (2010).

THE PURPOSE OF THIS REPORT IS TO INVESTIGATE AND IDENTIFY SOME OF THE BARRIERS THAT IMPEDE CANADIAN WOMEN’S ABILITY TO ACCESS VOLUNTARY STERILIZATION. THERE IS A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON HOW CANADA'S HISTORY OF EUGENICS AND COERCED STERILIZATION SHAPES THE CURRENT CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH WOMEN SEEK AND ARE TOO OFTEN REFUSED ACCESS TO PERMANENT CONTRACEPTION. METHODS: SIX QUALITATIVE, SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH SCHOLARS AND ACTIVISTS IN THE FIELD OF REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE (RJ) AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE. THE INTERVIEWS FACILITATED DISCUSSIONS ABOUT REPRODUCTIVE AUTONOMY, PATIENT RIGHTS, AND PATRIARCHAL ATTITUDES IN MEDICINE. AN RJ FRAMEWORK AND THEMATIC ANALYSIS WERE USED TO UNCOVER SYSTEMIC BARRIERS FROM THE INTERVIEW RESPONSES. RESULTS: AS DISCOVERED THROUGH THE INTERVIEWS, THE MOST PREVALENT BARRIERS TO ACCESS TO VOLUNTARY STERILIZATION IN CONTEMPORARY CANADA INCLUDE RACE, CLASS, LANGUAGE, ETHNICITY, DISABILITY, AGE AND PARITY. AN RJ FRAMEWORK IDENTIFIES HISTORICAL PARALLELS TO THESE PRESENT-DAY BARRIERS BY LOOKING AT THE HISTORICAL AND COLONIAL FORCES THAT DISEMPOWER INTERSECTIONAL MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES AND INFLUENCE THEIR REPRODUCTIVE DECISIONS TODAY. DISCUSSIONS: CANADA’S EUGENICS ATTITUDES FROM THE PAST SEEP INTO THE CURRENT BARRIERS TO ACCESS FACED BY WOMEN OF COLOUR, LOW-INCOME WOMEN, FEMALE NEWCOMERS, WOMEN WITH DISABILITIES, AND YOUNG OR NULLIPAROUS WOMEN. THE ASSUMPTION THAT THESE WOMEN ARE NOT CAPABLE OF DECIDING THE RIGHT COURSE OF ACTION FOR THEIR OWN BODIES AND THUS SHOULD NOT BE TRUSTED BY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS IN MAKING THESE DECISIONS IS A CONSISTENT PROBLEM IN BOTH TIME FRAMES. CONCLUSION: THE RESTRICTIONS AND MODES OF DISEMPOWERMENT PLACED ON VARIOUSLY POSITIONED WOMEN IN THE PAST COME BACK IN A NEW FORM THAT LEADS TO THOSE SAME GROUPS BEING DOUBTED AND DENIED REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE IN THE PRESENT. MANY OF THE INTERVIEWEES BELIEVED THAT INCREASING DIVERSITY IN THE MEDICAL FIELD IS NECESSARY TO HELP ALLEVIATE THE DISCREPANCIES IN HOW CONTRACEPTIVE HEALTHCARE IS GIVEN. © ADAN AMER. (2022).

POSITIONING HER WORK OF AUTOTHEORY WITHIN THE PROP 8 CAMPAIGN TO OPPOSE MARRIAGE EQUALITY, NELSON’S THE ARGONAUTS FLESHES OUT THE NEED TO CHALLENGE QUEER THEORY’S ABANDONMENT OF QUEER FAMILIES AND THEIR CHILDREN AND INSTEAD TO POSITION QUEER MOTHERS AND OTHER PARENTS AS RESOURCES FOR MORE EXPANSIVE AND INCLUSIVE POLITICAL PROJECTS TO SUPPORT DIVERSE LGBTQ+ KINSHIP FORMATIONS. IN THIS WAY, HER BOOK CONNECTS TO THE REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE MOVEMENT BECAUSE THE CONSERVATIVE RIGHT IS USING FEARS ABOUT SEXUAL DEVIANCE IN CONTRAST TO VISIONS OF HETERONORMATIVE FAMILY STRUCTURES TO SUPPORT POLICIES THAT DISENFRANCHISE PARENTS THAT DO NOT FIT INTO THIS MODEL. EVEN AS NELSON’S WORK AFFIRMS THE IMPORT OF RENDERINGS OF QUEER MOTHERHOOD, SHE DOES NOT ADDRESS THE KINDS OF CHALLENGES THAT MANY TWENTY-FIRST-CENTURY QUEER AND TRANSGENDER PARENTS FACE FROM DECIDEDLY DIFFERENT SOCIO-ECONOMIC CLASSES AS WELL AS BLACK, INDIGENOUS, AND LATINX PARENTS IMPACTED BY A VARIETY OF OPPRESSIVE STRUCTURES. THUS, HER VISIONS OF QUEER MOTHERHOOD ODDLY ARE DISCONNECTED FROM LEADING FEMINIST THEORISTS OF REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE, INCLUDING LORETTA ROSS (2017), RICKIE SOLINGER (2017), DOROTHY ROBERTS (1997), LAURA BRIGGS (2017), AND OTHERS. BY BRINGING NELSON’S TEXT INTO CONVERSATION WITH THESE THEORISTS, THIS CHAPTER SERVES AS AN INVITATION FOR QUEER THEORISTS TO ENGAGE MORE FULLY WITH DIVERSE FEMINIST THEORISTS OF REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE IN ORDER TO PROMOTE COALITIONAL POLITICAL PROJECTS THAT ADDRESS MULTIPLE ISSUES IMPACTING MINORITIZED PARENTS, THEIR CHILDREN, AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. © THE AUTHOR(S), UNDER EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG 2022.";"10.1007/978-3-030-99530-0_12";"BOOK CHAPTER"

ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER WOMEN HAVE A MATERNAL MORTALITY RATIO OF 16.4 DEATHS PER 100,000 INDIGENOUS WOMEN GIVING BIRTH (CLARK ET AL 2019). DISPARITIES IN REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE OFTEN PERSIST THROUGH THE ERASURE OF LIVED EXPERIENCES. MY WORK EXAMINES BIRTH STORIES (RECOUNTING VIA RECORDED, PODCASTED INTERVIEW) WITH NARRATIVE ANALYSIS AND POETIC INQUIRY. WHILE PERSONAL ESSAYS AND SPOKEN BIRTH STORIES RELAY NARRATIVES AS THEY ARE RECALLED, EXAMINING POETRY (THROUGH POETIC INQUIRY) WILL ALLOW EXPLORATION OF NARRATIVE IN WAYS THAT CAN BE LIKENED TO EXPERIENCES OF MATERNAL/PREGNANT PHENOMENOLOGIES (I.E., INTERSUBJECTIVITY, MULTIPLE TEMPORALITIES).

BIRTHING ON COUNTRY HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS THE PRACTICE OF GIVING BIRTH ON TRADITIONAL LANDS, OR WITH ELEMENTS OF FIRST NATIONS GROUPS’ CULTURES, INCORPORATED INTO THE PROCESS. BEING BORN ON COUNTRY “CONNECTS AN ABORIGINAL PERSON TO THE LAND AND COMMUNITY IN A DEEPLY CULTURAL WAY AND AFFORDS LIFE-LONG PRIVILEGES SUCH AS HUNTING AND FISHING RIGHTS, AS WELL AS LIFELONG RESPONSIBILITIES FOR LOOKING AFTER COUNTRY, BOTH LAND AND PEOPLE” (FELTON-BUSCH, CONTEMPORARY NURSE 33:161–162, 2009). BIRTHING ON COUNTRY IS ALSO A MATERNAL CARE SERVICE INITIATIVE, AVAILABLE TO SOME BIRTHING PEOPLE IN AUSTRALIA.

FOR POOR WOMEN IN INDIA, “A SAFE AND DIGNIFIED CONTEXT” CAN OFTEN BE CONDITIONAL, PARTIAL, OR EVEN ABSENT, IN SPITE OF THE EXISTENCE OF SEVERAL GOVERNMENT MATERNITY BENEFIT SCHEMES TO ENSURE POSITIVE REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. ALTHOUGH THE STORIES OF POOR INDIAN MOTHERS ARE OFTEN SILENCED, THERE HAVE BEEN SOME EFFORTS BY ACTIVIST FILMMAKERS TO DOCUMENT THEIR EXPERIENCES. ANHAD FILMS HAS MADE TWO YOUTUBE DOCUMENTARIES, “IT TAKES A VILLAGE TO SAVE A MOTHER’S LIFE” AND “JANAM AUR JEEVAN” (BIRTH AND LIFE), ON THE REPRODUCTIVE EXPERIENCES OF POOR INDIAN MOTHERS IN RURAL LOCATIONS.

STUDYING THE NARRATIVES OF DELIVERIES IN ANGLOPHONE LITERATURE REFLECTS ISSUES ABOUT PHYSICAL MOTHERHOOD, POWER, AND THE PERCEPTION OF BODIES SOCIALIZED AS FEMININE. DESPITE THE ORDINARINESS OF BIRTH IN SOCIETIES, THIS CRUCIAL EVENT IS SELDOM RECOUNTED IN LITERATURE. IN MOST CASES, AN ELLIPSIS OR A SUMMARY COMES TO CONCEAL THE PROCESS OF LABOR. THE FEMININE BODY, CONCEIVED AS OBSCENE, IS CURRENTLY ERASED OR DEHUMANIZED, AND WOMEN’S VOICES ARE SILENCED. BIRTHING BODIES, EVEN MORE WHEN THEY ARE RACIALIZED, ARE MADE MERE OBJECTS OF THE OBSTETRICAL WESTERN MALE POWER AND GAZE. CULTURAL AND RELIGIOUS REPRESENTATIONS HAVE CONSIDERABLY SHAPED THE NARRATIVES OF INTIMATE FEMININE BODILY EXPERIENCES, NOTABLY THROUGH THE DECORPOREALIZATION OF THE PROCESS OF CHILDBIRTH, AND THE DEVALUATION OF THE MATERIALITY OF MOTHERHOOD.

ALTHOUGH “MORE THAN 50% OF CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE IN CANADA ARE INDIGENOUS,” THEY “ACCOUNT FOR LESS THAN 8% OF THE CHILD POPULATION” (QAQQAQ 2021) AND “[I]NFANT MORTALITY AMONG FIRST NATIONS PEOPLE WITH STATUS IS ALMOST TWICE THE RATE OF THE GENERAL CANADIAN POPULATION” (HEALTH COUNCIL OF CANADA 2011, 45).

GROUNDED IN REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE AND TRAUMA-INFORMED CARE, BREASTFEEDING AWARENESS AND EMPOWERMENT (BAE) HAS DEVELOPED A PROGRAM TITLED BAE CAFE TO DIRECTLY ADDRESS THESE GAPS BY PROVIDING COMMUNITY-BASED LACTATION AND PERINATAL MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT. A LITERATURE REVIEW IDENTIFIED KEY PROGRAMMATIC GAPS, NAMELY, ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE RELEVANT TO TROUBLESHOOTING BREASTFEEDING, PEER SUPPORT, COMMUNITY SUPPORT AND HEALTHCARE SYSTEM SUPPORT, AND SYSTEM-LEVEL FACTORS THAT IMPEDE FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES FROM ACCESSING LACTATION SUPPORT. (2) METHODS: THIS PAPER DESCRIBES BAE CAFE THROUGH A GROUP PROCESS OBSERVATION AND PARTICIPANT SURVEY. (3) RESULTS: THE OBSERVATION OF GROUPS HIGHLIGHTED THE CORE ELEMENTS OF THE BAE CAFE MODEL: KNOWLEDGE, SUPPORT AND MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT IN A PEER DRIVEN FORMAT. PARTICIPANT SURVEY FEEDBACK WAS OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE AND HIGHLIGHTED THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF LACTATION SUPPORT FOR BLACK WOMEN BY BLACK WOMEN AND BAE’S ROLE IN PARTICIPANTS’ DECISIONS TO CONTINUE BREASTFEEDING.

THIS OBSTETRIC VIOLENCE INCLUDED DENIAL OF CARE AND FAILURE TO MEET STANDARDS OF CARE, CRIMINALISATION, GASLIGHTING, PHYSICAL VIOLENCE, AND DISCRIMINATION. WE SHOW HOW ABORTION-RELATED OBSTETRIC VIOLENCE IS USED AS A MEANS TO PUNISH AND CONTROL FEMINISED SUBJECTS THAT CONTRADICT SOCIAL AND LEGAL MANDATES REGARDING ABORTION AND GENDER.

WE SURVEY THE EUGENIC RATIONALE OF THE STATE WHERE THE LAW ALLOWS FOR TERMINATION OF EARLY-STAGE PREGNANCIES, WHILE LATER PREGNANCIES CAN BE TERMINATED ON MEDICAL GROUNDS ALONE, WITH A NOTABLE EXCEPTION MADE WHEN THE FOETUS IS ‘ABNORMAL,’ GRANTING AN ALMOST UNCONDITIONAL RIGHT TO ABORTION. RELYING ON SOME PROMINENT DISABILITY RIGHTS ACTIVISTS’ POSITIONS ON DISABILITY-SELECTIVE ABORTIONS, WE EXAMINE COURT ORDERS TO HIGHLIGHT EXCEEDINGLY INCONSISTENT INDIAN JURISPRUDENCE ON DISABILITY-SELECTIVE ABORTION. WE EMPLOY THEORIES OF THE SOCIAL MODEL ON DISABILITY AND THE REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE FRAMEWORK TO ADVOCATE FOR A RIGHTS-CUM-REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE APPROACH.

IT TRACES THE EMERGENCE AND GROWTH OF TWO SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVES ON POPULATION FROM THE 1920S TO THE PRESENT.

FIRST, IT ARGUES THAT, WHILE BOTH THE RIGHT TO GENDER IDENTITY AND THE RIGHT TO SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH ARE PART OF THE INDIVISIBLE CORE OF HUMAN RIGHTS, IN PRACTICE TRANS PEOPLE ARE FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THEM. UNDERSTANDING THIS SCENARIO REQUIRES FOCUSING ON THE EUGENIC DIMENSIONS OF TRANS POLICIES, EVEN IN STATES WHERE THE RECOGNITION OF A GENDER IDENTITY OTHER THAN THAT ASSIGNED AT BIRTH IS NOT TIED TO SURGICAL OR HORMONAL COMPROMISES. THE CONCEPT OF “PASSIVE EUGENICS”, COINED OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO BY JAMES BOWMAN, OFFERS A VALUABLE KEY IN THIS RESPECT. SECOND, THE PAPER HIGHLIGHTS SOME FACTORS THAT HINDER A SUCCESSFUL APPROACH TO THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND RIGHTS OF TRANS PEOPLE. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE: THE NORMATIVE IMAGERIES ABOUT THE REPRODUCTIVE CAPACITIES AND DESIRES OF TRANS PEOPLE, REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT PREGNANCY AND “WOMANHOOD”, AND THE FORM TAKEN BY IDENTITY POLITICS IN CONTEMPORARY FEMINIST MOVEMENTS.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER WAS TO SYNTHESIZE THE KEY RESULTS AND FINDINGS PRESENTED BY MEMBERS OF THE FP COMMUNITY AT THE 2018 ICFP CONFERENCE. METHODS MORE THAN 700 ABSTRACTS FROM ALL 15 CONFERENCE TRACKS WERE REVIEWED AND 64 ABSTRACTS TOTAL WERE SELECTED FOR THIS PAPER BASED ON THE NOVELTY AND URGENCY OF THE FINDINGS. THE CONTENT ANALYSIS OF CONFERENCE ABSTRACTS WERE GROUPED INTO SIX FINAL THEMATIC AREAS. RESULTS 1) INVESTING IN FAMILY PLANNING FOR A LIFETIME OF RETURNS. FP CONTINUES TO FACE A SHORTAGE OF FUNDING. DOMESTICALLY BASED AND LOCALLY OWNED FUNDING MODELS PROVIDE ALTERNATIVE FINANCING SOLUTIONS. 2) ADDRESSING INEQUITIES IN FAMILY PLANNING FOR KEY POPULATIONS. VARIOUS POPULATIONS STILL FACE CHALLENGES IN ACCESSING FP. YOUTH-INCLUSIVE AND USER-CENTERED PROGRAMMING SHOW PROMISE IN ADDRESSING SUCH CHALLENGES. 3) REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE, UNSAFE ABORTIONS TEND TO BE MORE COMMON AMONG YOUNGER, POOR, UNEDUCATED AND RURAL WOMEN. LEGISLATION IS STILL NEEDED TO FACILITATE A CULTURE OF SAFE ABORTIONS. 4) COUPLE DYNAMICS AND DECISION-MAKING. COUPLES WHO SHARE EQUITABLE RESPONSIBILITY IN DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES ARE MORE LIKELY TO USE CONTRACEPTIVES; COUPLE DISAGREEMENT INFLUENCES WOMEN’S DECISIONS TO COVERTLY USE FP. 5) MALE INVOLVEMENT IN PROGRAMMING. MALE CHAMPIONS CAN SUCCESSFULLY PROMOTE UPTAKE OF FP. GENDER-TRANSFORMATIVE PROGRAMMING PROMOTES GENDER EQUITY AND IMPACTS BEHAVIOR CHANGE. 6) BREAKTHROUGHS IN NOVEL CONTRACEPTIVES AND SYSTEMS IMPROVEMENT IN FAMILY PLANNING.

THE FEMINIST OPINION HIGHLIGHTS THE WAYS THE ACTUAL JUDGMENT DISTORTS BOTH THE LAW AND THE REALITY OF WOMEN’S EXPERIENCE OF HARM. THE ACCOMPANYING COMMENTARY SITUATES THIS CASE IN THE HISTORY OF RACIALLY BASED INVOLUNTARY STERILIZATION AND BOTH MEDICAL AND JUDICIAL DISMISSIVENESS OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE HARM, AND THUS SHEDS LIGHT ON HOW TORT LAW HAS FAILED TO DETER THIS ABUSIVE PRACTICE. © CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY PRESS 2020.";"10.1017/9781108613293.010";"BOOK CHAPTER"

PLOS ONE";1;2020;"SEX-POSITIVE CRIMINOLOGY ‘I’M GOING TO LOOK FOR YOU AND TAKE YOUR KIDS’: REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE IN THE CONTEXT OF IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT";"SEX-POSITIVE CRIMINOLOGY PROPOSES A NEW WAY TO THINK ABOUT SEXUALITY IN THE FIELDS OF CRIMINOLOGY AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE. SEX-POSITIVITY IS FRAMED AS A HUMANIZING APPROACH TO SEXUALITY THAT SUPPORTS THE WELL-BEING OF SELF AND OTHERS. IT IS ROOTED IN THE PRINCIPLE OF ACTIVE AND ONGOING CONSENT, AND IT ENCOURAGES PERSPECTIVES THAT VALUE BODILY AUTONOMY, THE RIGHT TO ACCESS EDUCATION, AND RESPECT FOR SEXUAL DIFFERENCE. IN THIS BOOK, THE AUTHORS ARGUE THAT INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS PRISONS, SCHOOLS, AND HEALTHCARE FACILITIES, AS WELL AS AGENTS OF GOVERNMENTS, SUCH AS LAW ENFORCEMENT, CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS, AND POLITICIANS, CAN UNDULY CAUSE HARM AND PERPETUATE STIGMA THROUGH THE REGULATION AND CRIMINALIZATION OF SEXUALITY. IN ORDER TO CRITIQUE INSTITUTIONS THAT CRIMINALIZE AND REGULATE SEXUALITY, THE AUTHORS OF SEX-POSITIVE CRIMINOLOGY EXAMINE CASE STUDIES EXPLORING THE CRIMINALIZATION OF COMMERCIAL SEX AND RELATED HARM (AT THE HANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT) EXPERIENCED BY THOSE WHO SELL SEX. THEY INVESTIGATE SEX EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS, REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE IN COMMUNITIES AND INSTITUTIONS, AND RESTRICTIONS ON SEXUALITY IN PLACES LIKE PRISONS, JAILS, JUVENILE DETENTION, AND IMMIGRANT DETENTION FACILITIES. THEY LOOK INTO THE CRIMINALIZATION OF BDSM PRACTICES AND ADDRESS CONCERNS ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE'S SEXUALITY CONNECTED TO AGE OF CONSENT AND PRIVACY VIOLATIONS. THE AUTHORS DEMONSTRATE HOW A SEX-POSITIVE PERSPECTIVE COULD HELP CRIMINOLOGISTS, POLICYMAKERS, AND EDUCATORS UNDERSTAND NOT ONLY HOW TO MOVE AWAY FROM SEX-NEGATIVE FRAMEWORKS IN THEORY, POLICY, AND PRACTICE, BUT HOW SEX-POSITIVE CRIMINOLOGICAL FRAMEWORKS CAN BE A USEFUL TOOL TO REDUCE HARM AND INCREASE PERSONAL AGENCY. WRITTEN IN A CLEAR AND DIRECT STYLE, THIS BOOK WILL APPEAL TO STUDENTS AND SCHOLARS IN CRIMINOLOGY, SOCIOLOGY, SEXUALITY STUDIES, CULTURAL STUDIES, CRIMINAL JUSTICE, SOCIAL THEORY, AND ALL THOSE INTERESTED IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SEXUALITY AND THE CRIMINO-LEGAL SYSTEM. © 2021 AIMEE WODDA AND VANESSA R.

YET NO PRIOR RESEARCH HAS EXAMINED HOW IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT MIGHT INHIBIT REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE AND LIMIT INDIVIDUAL’S REPRODUCTIVE AUTONOMY. WE UTILIZED DATA FROM AN EXISTING STUDY THAT CONSISTED OF A PARTNERSHIP WITH A LATINO COMMUNITY IN MICHIGAN IN WHICH AN IMMIGRATION RAID RESULTED IN MULTIPLE ARRESTS AND DEPORTATIONS MIDWAY THROUGH DATA COLLECTION. USING CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY DATA (N = 192) WHERE NO ONE WAS RE-INTERVIEWED, WE USED ORDINAL LOGISTIC REGRESSION TO COMPARE DESIRED PREGNANCY TIMING OF INDIVIDUALS SURVEYED PRIOR TO AND AFTER THE RAID TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF AN IMMIGRATION RAID ON DESIRED TIMING OF NEXT PREGNANCY. WE THEN USED QUALITATIVE DATA—INCLUDING 21 IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS AND PARTICIPANT OBSERVATION—COLLECTED IN THE COMMUNITY AFTER THE RAID TO CONTEXTUALIZE OUR FINDINGS. CONTROLLING FOR SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, WE FOUND THAT LATINOS SURVEYED IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE RAID WERE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT A GREATER DESIRE TO DELAY CHILDBEARING THAN LATINOS SURVEYED BEFORE THE RAID OCCURRED. OUR QUALITATIVE DATA SHOWED THAT AN IMMIGRATION RAID HAS FINANCIAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS ON IMMIGRANT FAMILIES AND THAT A RAID MAY IMPACT REPRODUCTIVE AUTONOMY BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE FEARFUL OF THESE IMPACTS. THESE FINDING SUGGEST THAT CURRENT IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS MAY INFLUENCE REPRODUCTIVE DECISION-MAKING, IMPEDE LATINOS REPRODUCTIVE AUTONOMY, AND THAT FAMILY-FRIENDLY IMMIGRATION POLICY REFORM IS NEEDED. © 2019 FLEMING ET AL.

IN THE UNITED STATES, PHYSICIANS HAVE BEEN COMPLICIT IN MULTIPLE HISTORICAL REPRODUCTIVE INJUSTICES, INVOLVING COERCIVE STERILIZATION OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OF COLOR, LOW INCOME, AND DISABILITIES. CURRENTLY, REPRODUCTIVE INJUSTICES CONTINUE TO OCCUR; HOWEVER, PHYSICIANS HAVE NO FORMAL RJ MEDICAL EDUCATION TO ADDRESS INJUSTICES. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ENGAGE LEADING ADVOCATES WITHIN THE MOVEMENT USING A DELPHI METHOD TO IDENTIFY CRITICAL COMPONENTS FOR SUCH A CURRICULUM. APPROACH: IN 2016, WE INVITED 65 RJ ADVOCATES AND LEADERS TO PARTICIPATE IN AN EXPERT PANEL TO DESIGN RJ MEDICAL EDUCATION. A 3-ROUND DELPHI SURVEY WAS DISTRIBUTED ELECTRONICALLY TO IDENTIFY CONTENT FOR INCLUSION IN AN RJ CURRICULUM. IN THE NEXT 2 SURVEY ROUNDS, EXPERTS OFFERED FEEDBACK AND REVISIONS AND RATED AGREEMENT WITH INCLUDING CONTENT RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE FINAL CURRICULUM. WE CALCULATED DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS TO ANALYZE QUANTITATIVE DATA. A TEAM WITH EDUCATIONAL EXPERTISE WROTE LEARNING OUTCOMES BASED ON EXPERT CONTENT RECOMMENDATIONS. FINDINGS: OF THE 65 RJ ADVOCATES AND LEADERS INVITED, 41 PARTICIPATED ON THE EXPERT PANEL OF THE DELPHI SURVEY. IN THE FIRST SURVEY, THE EXPERT PANEL RECOMMENDED 58 RJ CONTENT AREAS THROUGH OPEN-ENDED RESPONSE. OVER THE NEXT 2 ROUNDS, THERE WAS CONSENSUS AMONG THE PANEL TO INCLUDE 52 OF 58 OF THESE AREAS IN THE CURRICULUM. RECOMMENDED CONTENT FELL INTO 11 BROAD DOMAINS: ACCESS, DISPARITIES, AND STRUCTURAL COMPETENCY; ADVOCACY; APPROACHES TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE; CONTEMPORARY LAW AND POLICY; CULTURAL SAFETY; HISTORICAL INJUSTICES; LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL, TRANSGENDER, QUEER/QUESTIONING, AND INTERSEX HEALTH; OPPRESSION, POWER, AND BIAS TRAINING; PATIENT CARE; REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH; AND RJ DEFINITIONS. THE 97 LEARNING OUTCOMES CREATED FROM THIS PROCESS REPRESENTED BOTH UNIQUE AND EXISTING EDUCATIONAL ELEMENTS. INSIGHTS: A COLLABORATIVE METHODOLOGY INFUSED WITH RJ VALUES CAN BRIDGE EXPERTS IN ADVOCACY AND ACADEMICS. NEW LEARNING OUTCOMES IDENTIFIED THROUGH THIS PROCESS CAN ENHANCE MEDICAL EDUCATION; HOWEVER, IT IS JUST AS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER EDUCATION IN RJ APPROACHES TO CARE AS IT IS KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THAT CARE. WE MUST EXPLORE THE PEDAGOGIC PROCESS OF RJ MEDICAL EDUCATION WHILE CONSIDERING THAT EXPERTISE IN THIS AREA MAY EXIST OUTSIDE OF THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY AND THUS THERE IS A NEED TO PARTNER WITH RJ ADVOCATES.

WHILE INCREASED USE OF THESE METHODS HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED RATES OF UNINTENDED PREGNANCY AND ABORTION IN ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS, THESE METHODS REQUIRE PROVIDER VISITS FOR METHOD INITIATION (AND OFTEN FOR DISCONTINUATION) THAT CAN BE SIGNIFICANT RATE-LIMITING STEPS FOR METHOD USE. WHEN ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS CHOOSE AN IUD FOR THEIR CONTRACEPTIVE METHOD, IT IS CRUCIAL THAT PROVIDERS WORK TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO BOTH INITIATION AND DISCONTINUATION OF THESE METHODS. FOR IUD INSERTIONS, PROPOSING CLINIC AND MEDICAL SYSTEM POLICIES THAT SUPPORT SAME-DAY INSERTION OF IUDS, IMMEDIATE POSTPARTUM INSERTION, AND IMMEDIATE POSTABORTION INSERTION CAN HELP REDUCE THESE BARRIERS.

THE LIMITED RESEARCH ON UNASSISTED BIRTH IN THE UNITED STATES FOCUSES ON WOMEN'S REASONS FOR MAKING THIS CHOICE. STUDIES SUGGEST WOMEN ARE COMMITTED TO BIRTHING WITHOUT A PROFESSIONAL AND THAT THIS CHOICE IS ROOTED IN RELIGIOUS OR NATURAL-FAMILY BELIEF SYSTEMS. THESE STUDIES DO NOT ADEQUATELY ACCOUNT FOR THE WAYS A FRAMEWORK OF “CHOICE” OBSCURES THE ROLE STRUCTURAL BARRIERS PLAY IN DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES. INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH ON UNASSISTED CHILDBIRTH FINDS THAT IT IS NOT ALWAYS A FIRST CHOICE AND MAY BE A LAST RESORT FOR WOMEN WHO HAVE HAD NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES WITH MATERNITY CARE. MORE RESEARCH ON UNASSISTED BIRTH IN THE UNITED STATES IS NEEDED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND IF PEOPLE FACE SIMILAR STRUCTURAL BARRIERS. IN THIS PAPER I EXAMINE HOW STRUCTURAL LIMITATIONS OF THE US HEALTHCARE SYSTEM INTERSECT WITH VALUES IN DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES ABOUT CHILDBIRTH. DRAWING ON IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WITH NINE WOMEN WHO GAVE BIRTH UNASSISTED IN THE UNITED STATES, I EXAMINE THE WOMEN'S SHARED IDEOLOGICAL COMMITMENTS, NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES WITH HEALTH CARE, AND BARRIERS FACED SEEKING CARE.

TODAY, GAMETE DONATION AND IVF ARE PERMITTED NOT ONLY FOR HETEROSEXUAL COUPLES, BUT ALSO FOR LESBIAN COUPLES AND SINGLE WOMEN, AND EMBRYO DONATION IS EXPECTED TO BECOME LEGALIZED SHORTLY WHICH WILL FURTHER INCREASE THE CHANCES FOR INVOLUNTARILY CHILDLESS PEOPLE TO BECOME PARENTS. IN RECENT YEARS, THE POSSIBILITY OF ALLOWING SURROGACY HAS BEEN DEBATED INCREASINGLY, WITH STRONGLY POLARIZED ARGUMENTS BOTH FOR AND AGAINST IT. RECENT REPORTS BY THE SWEDISH NATIONAL COUNCIL OF MEDICAL ETHICS AND A GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATION AGREED THAT THE POSSIBILITIES FOR INVOLUNTARILY CHILDLESS PEOPLE SHOULD BE INCREASED IN SEVERAL WAYS, BUT REACHED OPPOSING CONCLUSIONS CONCERNING SURROGACY.

DRAWING ON THREE YEARS OF INTENSIVE FIELDWORK AMONG 13 YOUNG ECONOMICALLY MARGINALIZED BLACK AND LATINA WOMEN, I DEMONSTRATE HOW FEMINIST IDEOLOGIES OF EMPOWERMENT INTERACT WITH PERVASIVE RISK NARRATIVES IN THE EVERYDAY LIVES OF MARGINALIZED WOMEN COMING OF AGE IN THE “SHADOW OF THE WOMEN’S MOVEMENT.” MY OBSERVATIONS SHOW THAT THE YOUNG WOMEN STRATEGICALLY NAVIGATE CIRCULATING RISK NARRATIVES ABOUT THEIR SEXUALITY BY CONSTRUCTING AN IDENTITY OF DISTANCE CHARACTERIZED BY FEMINIST IDEALS OF INDEPENDENCE, SELF-RESPECT, AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT TO DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM THESE NARRATIVES. HOWEVER, AS THEY CONSTRUCT THIS IDENTITY OF DISTANCE, THEY ALSO STIGMATIZE YOUNG MOTHERS AND POLICE THEIR OWN BODIES AND THE BODIES OF THEIR FRIENDS AND SISTERS. I DRAW ON WOMEN-OF-COLOR FEMINISM TO REFLECT ON THE UNCOMFORTABLE RELATIONSHIP—EVIDENT IN THE PROCESS OF A GROUP OF YOUNG WOMEN’S IDENTITY CONSTRUCTION—BETWEEN FEMINIST IDEOLOGIES OF EMPOWERMENT AND BOURGEOIS HETERONORMATIVITY THAT MARGINALIZES YOUNG WOMEN’S SEXUALITIES BY CONSTRUCTING TEEN MOTHERHOOD AS INHERENTLY PROBLEMATIC. © THE AUTHOR 2017.

IN THIS ARTICLE, I SUGGEST THAT A FRUITFUL STARTING POINT FOR A CONVERSATION ON HOW TO TACKLE SUCH A CHALLENGE IS TO EXAMINE THE WAY IN WHICH SURROGACY IS CONCEPTUALIZED. THUS, I EXAMINE HOW SCHOLARS HAVE QUERIED SURROGACY, ASKING HOW DIFFERENT CONCEPTUALIZATIONS OF WHO THIS REPRODUCTIVE PHENOMENON CONCERNS HAVE LED TO THE FORMULATIONS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF ‘TROUBLES’ OF SURROGACY. I DELINEATE THREE DIFFERENT CONCEPTUALIZATIONS OF SURROGACY. FIRSTLY, HOW SURROGACY AS A WAY TO MAKE PARENTS HAS TROUBLED SCHOLARS BECAUSE OF THE CONFLATION OF REPRODUCTION WITH CONSUMPTION, THEREBY MAKING REPRODUCTION A MATTER OF FINANCIAL RESOURCE. SECONDLY, THE TROUBLE EMERGING WHEN SURROGACY IS CONCEPTUALIZED AS BABY-MAKING RELATES TO HOW SURROGACY TURNS BABIES AND BODIES INTO COMMODITIES. THIRDLY, SURROGACY UNDERSTOOD AS A PHENOMENON THAT CONCERNS THE WOMEN GESTATING AND BIRTHING THE CHILDREN HAS BROUGHT ATTENTION TO ISSUES OF EXPLOITATION. THESE DIFFERENT FORMULATIONS OF TROUBLE POINT TOWARDS TENSIONS IN THE LITERATURE, WHILE ALSO OFFERING REMINDERS THAT SURROGACY IS NOT ONE THING ALONE; A FINDING THAT PROVIDES AN OPENING FOR NEW FORMS OF REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE.

THIS VANTAGE POINT OF EGG PROVIDERS CAN HELP LEND IMPORTANT INSIGHTS INTO THE WIDER PROCESSES OF FAMILY-MAKING ACROSS BORDERS TODAY. IT CENTRES ON ETHNOGRAPHIC RESEARCH CONDUCTED ON CONTEMPORARY CROSS-BORDER EGG PROVISION PERFORMED BY FEMALE MIGRANT WORKERS IN SPAIN. THROUGH THIS INTERSECTIONAL PERSPECTIVE, WE STAND TO GAIN DEEPER INSIGHTS INTO CROSS-BORDER REPRODUCTION MORE WIDELY. EGG PROVISION CAN BE A WAY FOR MIGRANT WOMEN TO GAIN TEMPORARY FINANCIAL BENEFIT. IN A SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT PROVIDE EQUAL ACCESS FOR MIGRANTS TO WORK AND CARE, FEMALE MIGRANTS MAKE THEMSELVES EXTRACTABLE COMMODITIES. AS SUCH, THEY ARE BOTH A COMMODITY AND A WORKER AT THE SAME TIME. THE EXAMPLE OF FEMALE MIGRANT WORKERS PROVIDING EGGS CAN BE USED TO REFLECT MORE GENERALLY ON EGG PROVISION, AND ON CROSS-BORDER REPRODUCTION AND REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE MODELS AS USED IN QUEER CROSS-BORDER FAMILY-BUILDING. TAKEN WITHIN THE BROADER FRAMEWORK OF REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE, AND WITH THE STRUGGLES OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL AND TRANSGENDER CROSS-BORDER REPRODUCTION IN MIND, THE PAPER BEGINS BY ASKING HOW THREE INTERSECTING INEQUALITIES DUE TO (1) MIGRATION/CITIZENSHIP, (2) JOBLESSNESS/CONTRACT WORKING AND (3) RACE FACILITATE THE INDUSTRY OF CROSS-BORDER REPRODUCTION? IN WHAT WAYS DO FEMALE MIGRANT WORKERS MOBILIZE THEIR REPRODUCTIVE POTENTIAL, INCLUDING TIME, WHITENESS, OTHER RACIAL/PHENOTYPIC SIMILARITY TO COMMISSIONING PARENTS, AND UNSTABLE WORK LIVES IN CROSS-BORDER EGG DONATION?

TAKING AS GIVEN THAT GAY MEN HAVE THE SAME ETHICAL RIGHT TO PURSUE SUCH REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIES AS HETEROSEXUAL COUPLES OR INDIVIDUALS, THIS ARTICLE ASKS WHETHER ACCESS TO EGG DONATION AND SURROGACY FOR GAY MEN SPECIFICALLY COULD BE CONSIDERED A MATTER NOT JUST OF (CONSUMER)RIGHTS, BUT OF JUSTICE. THE IDEA OF SHIFTING DISCOURSE ABOUT REPRODUCTION FROM THE LANGUAGE OF ‘RIGHTS’ TO THAT OF ‘JUSTICE’ IS MOST NOTABLY ARTICULATED BY WOMEN OF COLOUR. THEIR CALL FOR REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE SEEKS TO EXPAND DISCUSSION BEYOND THE NARROW RIGHT TO AN ABORTION (AS A NEGATIVE PRIVACY RIGHT)TO ENCOMPASS BROADER, POSITIVE RIGHTS, SUCH AS THE RIGHTS TO BEAR HEALTHY CHILDREN AND TO RAISE THEM IN SAFE ENVIRONMENTS. WHAT, IF ANYTHING, MIGHT WE LEARN FROM REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE MOVEMENTS ABOUT HOW TO FRAME GAY MEN'S DESIRE/DEMAND FOR ACCESS TO SURROGACY? WHILE I FIND SEVERAL PRODUCTIVE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS, TWO FACTORS LEAD ME TO ARGUE AGAINST UNDERSTANDING GAY ACCESS TO SURROGACY AS A MATTER OF JUSTICE: FIRST, THE NECESSARY RELIANCE ON WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE LABOUR; AND SECOND, THE LARGELY NON-STRUCTURAL CAUSES OF GAY COUPLES' INABILITY TO REPRODUCE. NEVERTHELESS, BY CONSIDERING TWO DRIVING FORCES BEHIND GAY MALE ASSISTED REPRODUCTION – SOCIAL NORMS FAVOURING BIOLOGICAL FAMILY FORMATION AND THE NEED FOR FAMILY SECURITY – I ULTIMATELY CONCLUDE THAT A BASIS FOR SOLIDARITY EXISTS BETWEEN GAY MEN AND REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE MOVEMENTS.

MASS INCARCERATION, THEN, DISRUPTS CONVENTIONAL MODES OF REPRODUCTION AND THREATENS REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE, SEPARATES FAMILIES AND FUNNELS CHILDREN INTO FOSTER CARE, DIVERTS FUNDS FROM SOCIAL SERVICES INTO PRISONS, RESTRICTS WOMEN'S ACCESS TO ABORTION AND ADEQUATE PREGNANCY CARE, SHACKLES WOMEN IN CHILDBIRTH, AND INCARCERATES PEOPLE DURING THEIR PRIME REPRODUCTIVE YEARS. BEYOND THESE OBVIOUS DISRUPTIONS TO REPRODUCTION, INCARCERATION ALSO CULTIVATES CERTAIN WAYS OF BEING A PARENT. MUCH OF THE CRITICAL LITERATURE ON MASS INCARCERATION FOCUSES ON MEN, LARGELY BECAUSE OF FEWER WOMEN AND MASCULINIST ASSUMPTIONS OF THE CARCERAL SYSTEM. THIS PAPER LOOKS SPECIFICALLY AT HOW WOMEN'S REPRODUCTION IS EXPERIENCED AND MANAGED BY CARCERAL INSTITUTIONS, AND HOW MASS INCARCERATION ITSELF IS A REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGY.

COPYRIGHT © THE WOMEN AND POLITICS RESEARCH SECTION OF THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE ASSOCIATION 2018. WHAT DO WOMEN ENDING THEIR PREGNANCIES WANT AND NEED TO HAVE A GOOD CLINICAL ABORTION EXPERIENCE? SINCE BIRTH EXPERIENCES ARE BETTER STUDIED, BIRTH STORIES ARE MORE READILY SHARED AND MANY WOMEN WHO HAVE HAD AN ABORTION HAVE ALSO GIVEN BIRTH, WE SOUGHT TO COMPARE WOMEN'S NEEDS AND PREFERENCES IN ABORTION TO THOSE IN BIRTH. WE CONDUCTED SEMI-STRUCTURED INTENSIVE INTERVIEWS WITH WOMEN WHO HAD BOTH EXPERIENCES IN THE UNITED STATES AND ANALYZED THEIR INTRAPARTUM AND ABORTION CARE NARRATIVES USING GROUNDED THEORY, IDENTIFYING NEEDS AND PREFERENCES IN ABORTION THAT WERE DISTINCT FROM BIRTH. BASED ON INTERVIEWS WITH TWENTY WOMEN, THREE THEMES EMERGED: TO BE AFFIRMED AS MORAL DECISION-MAKERS, TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE THEIR DEGREE OF AWARENESS DURING THE ABORTION, AND TO HAVE CARE PROVIDED IN A DISCREET MANNER TO AVOID BEING JUDGED BY OTHERS FOR HAVING AN ABORTION. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT SOME WOMEN HAVE DISTINCTIVE EMOTIONAL NEEDS AND PREFERENCES DURING ABORTION CARE, LIKELY DUE TO DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES AND SOCIOPOLITICAL CONTEXT OF ABORTION.

DESPITE POSITIVE TRENDS, THE UNITED STATES CONTINUES TO HAVE THE HIGHEST ADOLESCENT PREGNANCY RATE AMONG INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES WITH DATA. RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN ADOLESCENT PREGNANCY RATES CONTINUE TO EXIST, AS DO STATE-BASED DIFFERENCES IN PREGNANCY, BIRTH, AND ABORTION RATES. THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OBSTETRICIANS AND GYNECOLOGISTS SUPPORTS ACCESS FOR ADOLESCENTS TO ALL CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS APPROVED BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION. IN THE ABSENCE OF CONTRAINDICATIONS, PATIENT CHOICE SHOULD BE THE PRINCIPAL FACTOR IN PRESCRIBING ONE METHOD OF CONTRACEPTION OVER ANOTHER. DUAL METHOD USE—THE USE OF CONDOMS IN COMBINATION WITH MORE EFFECTIVE CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS TO PROTECT AGAINST SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS AND UNWANTED PREGNANCY—IS THE IDEAL CONTRACEPTIVE PRACTICE FOR ADOLESCENTS. JUST AS ADOLESCENTS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE FULL RANGE OF CONTRACEPTIVES, INCLUDING LONG-ACTING REVERSIBLE CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS, THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO DECLINE AND DISCONTINUE ANY METHOD ON THEIR OWN, WITHOUT BARRIERS. A REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE FRAMEWORK FOR CONTRACEPTIVE COUNSELING AND ACCESS IS ESSENTIAL TO PROVIDING EQUITABLE HEALTH CARE, ACCESSING AND HAVING COVERAGE FOR CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS, AND RESISTING POTENTIAL COERCION BY HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS THAT RESULTED IN MEASURABLE CHANGES IN ADOLESCENT CONTRACEPTIVE PRACTICES AND SEXUAL BEHAVIOR HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED, BUT NOT IMPLEMENTED UNIFORMLY NOR SUPPORTED BY POLICY IMPROVEMENTS. MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO DETERMINE WHICH PROGRAMS ARE MOST EFFECTIVE AND WHICH PROGRAMS DO NOT WORK.

DRAWING ON CANADIAN CATHOLIC NUNS’ UNIQUE ACCOUNTS OF THEIR EXPERIENCES WITH THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH, THIS CHAPTER BRINGS NUANCE TO THE COMPLICATED POWER DYNAMICS NAVIGATED BY WOMEN RELIGIOUS TO SHOW HOW WOMEN REMAIN EXCLUDED AND EXPLOITED IN VARIOUS WAYS IN THEIR OWN RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS. WE POINT TO THE INSTITUTIONALIZED ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH’S LONG-STANDING CONTROL OVER WOMEN’S REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS, AS WELL AS ITS ONGOING PROHIBITION AND RECENT CRIMINALIZATION OF WOMEN’S ORDINATION. WE ALSO ADDRESS RECENT STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS AT PLAY BY DRAWING ATTENTION TO A RECENT VATICAN INVESTIGATION AND ONGOING SURVEILLANCE OF WOMEN RELIGIOUS IN NORTH AMERICA UNDER NEWLY ESTABLISHED CHURCH DOCTRINE. WE VIEW THESE RECENT TACTICS AS EVIDENCE OF THE VATICAN’S RENEWED COMMITMENT TO EXISTING GENDER HIERARCHIES WITHIN THE CHURCH. FEMINIST INTERVENTION IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT CONSIDERING THIS DEEPENING PATRIARCHAL POWER AND HOW, BY EXTENSION, THE CHURCH IS REGRESSING RATHER THAN PROGRESSING TOWARDS GENDER EQUALITY, EVEN WHILE IT SHOWS EVIDENCE OF SHIFTING ATTITUDES ON OTHER SOCIAL ISSUES.

POPULATION DIVISION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS OF THE UNITED NATIONS SECRETARIAT, NEW YORK, 2015A) IS OCCURRING IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WHERE ABOUT 40% OF PREGNANCIES ARE UNPLANNED OR UNWANTED (SEDGH ET AL., STUD FAMILY PLAN 45(3):301–314, 2014). THESE UNINTENDED PREGNANCIES RESULT IN EITHER UNSAFE ABORTIONS OR BIRTHS THAT ARE HIGH RISK AND FREQUENTLY CAUSE THE SUFFERING OF ILL HEALTH OR PREMATURE DEATH. REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES THAT PROVIDE SAFE CHILDBIRTH, MODERN CONTRACEPTION AND SAFE ABORTION CARE ARE ESSENTIAL TO AVOIDING AND RELIEVING SUFFERING CAUSED BY RISKS TO HEALTH. REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE ALSO ALLEVIATES THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS OF RAPID POPULATION GROWTH ON THE WELFARE OF PEOPLE AND ON LIFE-SUPPORTING PLANETARY ECOSYSTEMS. FAMILY PLANNING PROTECTS AND ADVANCES HUMAN RIGHTS AND JUSTICE, AND ENHANCES PERSONAL, FAMILY AND NATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. IN 2014 AN ESTIMATED 225 MILLION WOMEN IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WHO WANTED TO AVOID A PREGNANCY WERE NOT USING AN EFFECTIVE CONTRACEPTIVE METHOD BECAUSE THEY LACKED INFORMATION, ACCESS OR FACE OTHER BARRIERS TO USING CONTRACEPTION (SINGH ET AL. ADDING IT UP: THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF INVESTING IN SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH 2014. GUTTMACHER INSTITUTE AND UNITED NATIONS POPULATION FUND, NEW YORK, 2014). ACCESS TO SAFE ABORTION SERVICES IS EVEN MORE CONSTRAINED. TO PROVIDE FAMILY PLANNING TO ALL WOMEN IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WHO WANT TO END OR DELAY CHILDBEARING REQUIRES AN INCREASE FROM AN ESTIMATED $4.1 BILLION FROM ALL SOURCES TO $9.4 BILLION ANNUALLY (SINGH ET AL. ADDING IT UP: THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF INVESTING IN SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH 2014. GUTTMACHER INSTITUTE AND UNITED NATIONS POPULATION FUND, NEW YORK, 2014). WITH SUFFICIENT POLITICAL WILL AND DEVOTION OF ADEQUATE FINANCIAL AND OTHER RESOURCES THE HIGH-FERTILITY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, SUCH AS THOSE IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA, COULD MAKE THE TRANSITION FROM HIGH TO LOW BIRTH RATES, SLOW THEIR RAPID POPULATION GROWTH AND ACHIEVE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PROGRESS. © SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG 2017.";"10.1007/978-3-319-51391-1_15";"BOOK CHAPTER"

POLICY AND POLITICS IN ASSISTED REPRODUCTION";"BREASTFEEDING IS A UNIQUELY EMBODIED PART OF PARENTING. IT IS A TIME-CONSUMING TASK THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY CENTERED ON MOTHERS' BODIES FOR AS LONG AS BREASTFEEDING OCCURS, WHICH MAY BE WEEKS, MONTHS, ONE YEAR, OR MUCH LONGER. IN THIS ARTICLE I ARGUE THAT AN ENHANCED AND SUSTAINED RESEARCH FOCUS ON THE EMBODIED DIMENSIONS OF BREASTFEEDING HAS THE POTENTIAL TO RAISE QUESTIONS AND PROVIDE INSIGHTS ABOUT BREASTFEEDING INITIATION AND DURATION, A MAJOR CONCERN OF POLICYMAKERS AND OTHERS. THREE UNDEREXPLORED AREAS OF RESEARCH INTO THE EMBODIED ASPECTS OF BREASTFEEDING INCLUDE LACTATION ACTIVISM (LACTIVISM), THE DYADIC (MOTHER-CHILD/CHILDREN) BODY WORK OF BREASTFEEDING, AND THE EFFORTS AND BELIEFS OF THE PROFESSIONALS WHO SUPPORT MOTHERS AS THEY INITIATE AND CONTINUE TO BREASTFEED. ACCOMPLISHING REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE FOR ALL WOMEN REQUIRES DEVELOPING A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF VARIATIONS IN THE SOCIAL AND INDIVIDUAL CONTEXT FOR THE EMBODIED PRACTICE OF BREASTFEEDING AND USING THIS KNOWLEDGE TO CREATE EFFECTIVE SOCIAL POLICIES. © 2013 COPYRIGHT TAYLOR AND FRANCIS GROUP, LLC. THIS PAPER INTERPRETS THE BRITISH LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THAT INITIATED THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE NATIONAL REGULATION OF EMBRYO RESEARCH AND FERTILITY SERVICES AND EXAMINES SUBSEQUENT EFFORTS TO RESTRAIN THE ASSISTED REPRODUCTION INDUSTRY. AFTER DESCRIBING AND EVALUATING BRITISH REGULATORY MEASURES, I CONSIDER SUCCESSIVE FAILURES TO CONTROL THE ASSISTED REPRODUCTION INDUSTRY IN THE US. I DISCUSS DISPARITIES BETWEEN UK AND US REGULATORY INITIATIVES AND THEIR BEARING ON REGULATION IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THEN I TURN TO THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL STRUCTURES IN WHICH THE ASSISTED REPRODUCTION INDUSTRY IS EMBEDDED. I ARGUE THAT REGULATORY BODIES ARE SELDOM NEUTRAL ARBITERS. THEY TEND TO RESPOND MOST READILY TO SPECIAL INTERESTS AND NEGLECT STRATEGIES THAT COULD MORE EFFECTIVELY MEET THE HEALTH NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE THEY REPRESENT. NEITHER NATIONAL NOR INTERNATIONAL BODIES HAVE AGGRESSIVELY PURSUED POLICIES TO HARNESS THE INDUSTRY, REDUCE INFERTILITY RATES, OR MEET THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WHOSE FERTILITY IS THREATENED BY SUBSTANDARD HEALTHCARE AND ENVIRONMENTAL NEGLECT. IN CONCLUSION, I CONSIDER RECENT INITIATIVES BY ACTIVIST GROUPS TO MOUNT AN ALTERNATIVE RESPONSE TO THE INDUSTRY'S CURRENT PRACTICES AND BUILD A TRANSNATIONAL REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE MOVEMENT. © 2010 BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD.";"10.1080/1554477X.2013.835680 10.1111/j.1467-8519.2010.01869.x";"ARTICLE ARTICLE"

IN THIS CASE-STUDY-STYLE ANALYSIS, THE PROBLEMATIC WAYS IN WHICH THE POPULAR MEDIA FRAME ISSUES RELATED TO REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE ARE EXPLORED. IN BOTH POPULAR MUSIC AND TELEVISION SERIES, REPRODUCTION IS FRAMED IN WAYS THAT LIMIT REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE FOR WOMEN. WOMEN WHO ACTIVELY CHOOSE TO USE BIRTH CONTROL ARE PORTRAYED NEGATIVELY, MISINFORMATION ABOUT CONDOMS AND ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE IS PERPETUATED, AND STEREOTYPES ABOUT WOMEN AND REPRODUCTION ARE REINFORCED. BASED UPON THESE ANALYSES, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT FURTHER SYSTEMATIC CONTENT ANALYSES BE PERFORMED IN ADDITION TO EXPERIMENTAL WORK ON THE EFFECTS OF MEDIA FRAMING ON SUPPORT (OR LACK OF SUPPORT) FOR POLICIES RELATED TO REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE. IT IS ALSO SUGGESTED THAT DIFFERENT TYPES OF MEDIA RELATED TO WOMEN'S REPRODUCTION MIGHT BE USED TO HELP YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN DEVELOP SKILLS FOR CRITICALLY DECONSTRUCTING AND REFRAMING MESSAGES ABOUT SEX AND REPRODUCTION PUT FORTH BY VARIOUS FORMS OF MEDIA.";"10.1080/14681810802639830";"ARTICLE"
