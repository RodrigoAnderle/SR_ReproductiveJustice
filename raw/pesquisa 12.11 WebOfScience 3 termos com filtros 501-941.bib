Abstract = {Gestational surrogacy - carrying someone else's baby (or babies) to term
   and giving birth to them - is perhaps one of the most intimate acts a
   human being can perform for others. However, the proliferation of
   commercial surrogacy has drawn concern and criticism, with many scholars
   arguing that it both creates and exacerbates global social and economic
   inequalities. Commercial surrogacy thus raises both the possibility of
   global intimate connection and the specter of reproductive exploitation.
   I therefore explore the various, shifting, and often discordant desires
   for intimate connection between the intending parent(s), the surrogate
   mother, and the resulting child(ren) in commercial surrogacy. I then
   examine how those intimacies intersect with commercial surrogacy's
   socioeconomic inequalities. Weighing commercial surrogacy's driving
   desires and intimate practices against its commercialization, I end with
   a reconsideration of the procreative desires and intimate practices that
   spur current international commercial surrogacy (ICS), urging an
   emphasis on reproductive justice.},

Abstract = {InThe New Eugenics: Selective Breeding in an Era of Reproductive
   Technologies, JudithDaar (2017)advocates for increased access to
   assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and minimizes concerns about
   the potential ``eugenic logic{''} of some procreative choices. Although
   Daar's goal of expanded access is laudable, her argument suggests an
   unresolved tension between the moral equality of persons and individual
   reproductive freedom. Exploring that tension, this paper argues that
   efforts to expand access to ART must still grapple with the ``eugenic
   mentality{''} of quality control that some forms of reproductive and
   genetic technologies enable.},

Abstract = {Across the world, women experience violations to their reproductive
   health and threats to their educational aspirations that limit their
   achievement. Reproductive health and education are examples of women's
   human rights that are connected by systemic gender inequalities that
   lead millions of women to experience discrimination and stereotyping
   that threaten these basic rights. The current study uses a reproductive
   justice framework to examine how a community-based organization led by a
   group of women in rural Nicaragua challenges gendered psychosocial
   processes related to women's rights violations. In partnership with a
   grassroots local organization, we used structural equation modeling to
   demonstrate, in a sample of almost 300 women, that organizational
   participation was positively related to women's reproductive
   decision-making and educational aspiration, in part due to relationships
   with women's self-esteem and sense of powerlessness in sociopolitical
   matters. Given the persistent role of gendered inequities in the
   reproductive decision-making and educational aspirations of girls and
   women, considering the social-structural contexts that enable or limit
   rights is imperative to creating viable routes to gender justice.},

Abstract = {The Handmaid's Tale (1985), by Canadian author Margaret Atwood, features
   a reproductive dystopia called the Republic of Gilead that is set in a
   near-futuristic USA. However compelling, the association of the novel
   with the politics of abortion in the era of President Donald J. Trump
   has sidelined its temporal origins in the first term of Ronald Reagan's
   presidency and overshadowed the plot's hinge: a fertility decline
   triggered mainly by a series of ecological crises leads to the founding
   of the Republic of Gilead as a white supremacist, patriarchal,
   evangelical Christian, theocratic stronghold bent on improving the white
   birth rate. This backdrop is indebted to Atwood's own longstanding
   ecofeminist philosophy, which means that the novel is as much about
   Reagan-era abortion politics as it is about concerns over environmental
   degradation in the early 1980s. Approaching the novel along these
   parallel tracks provides ample opportunity to spotlight its real-life
   historical context, using it as a springboard to examine the plot's
   racial implications and the knock-on emergence of movements for
   environmental justice and reproductive justice, coming full circle to
   the Trump era.},

   mixed methods analysis of classed constructions of pregnancy resolution},

Abstract = {Women negotiate gendered discourses of reproductive agency in resolving
   unplanned pregnancies. Invoking an intersectional lens, this paper
   examines how these discursive dynamics differentiate across social class
   in the Global South context of the Philippines. Utilizing a novel mixed
   methods strategy, we triangulate quantitative findings from a Q sort
   task and qualitative accounts of pregnancy resolution to identify
   classed discourses of reproductive agency as (a) reclaiming maternal
   virtue and (b) asserting autonomous choice. Statistical analysis reveals
   significant discursive divergence across class, wherein working-class
   women primarily adopt maternal virtue discourses while middle-class
   women disproportionately subscribe to autonomous choice. Interpretative
   analysis of women's accounts complicates this bifurcated
   characterization by surfacing the diverse ways by which women negotiate
   both discourses in narratives of abortion and carrying to term. We
   discuss our contributions to the literature in terms of multilevel
   theoretical engagement with classed complexity in gendered issues like
   reproductive agency as well as innovating mixed methods in
   intersectional research. We conclude with reflections on advancing
   reproductive justice, especially in Global South societies like the
   Philippines.},

Abstract = {I examine writing produced in an online community of childbirth advocacy
   during a 2010 National Institutes of Health Conference convened to
   develop a consensus resolution on best practices regarding vaginal birth
   after cesarean (VBAC). Through an analysis of blog posts and comment
   threads written in response to the conference proceedings, I find that
   participants in the feminist counterpublic of birth advocacy utilize
   three primary strategies: they redefine VBAC as ``just birth{''} rather
   than a medical ``procedure;{''} they recontextualize the biomedical use
   of ``risk{''} to include other factors outside of the immediate context
   of the hospital; and they reframe VBAC as a right rather than a
   preference. Together, these strategies work together to demonstrate the
   incommensurability of ``shared doctor-patient decision making{''} within
   the current biomedical model of care. This move, toward a rights-based
   framework within a more highly contextualized systemic critique of
   health care, positions VBAC to be an issue that could link birth
   advocacy to a larger feminist health justice movement.},

Abstract = {This essay proposes an anti-work Christian ethics of work: that is, an
   ethics of work that breaks Christianity's complicity with capitalism's
   death-dealing ideology of work. Taking up feminist anti-work theory's
   call to the ``refusal of work,{''} the essay first clarifies the
   relationship between work and care within the capitalist work-system (a
   concept coined here by the author). It then argues that the activist
   framework known as reproductive justice-once it is expanded to the whole
   sphere of social reproduction-offers a moral norm adequate for an
   anti-work Christian ethics of work. This new norm resonates with the
   Christian account of Creation, in which roach circulates for the
   joy-filled liveliness of all.},

Title = {What leisure? Surfeminism in an era of Trump},
Journal = {PALGRAVE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {5},
Month = {APR 30},
Abstract = {Powerful new feminisms are challenging the rise of the Global Right
   through mass mobilization, demands for accountability, and innovative
   opposition, such as \#MeToo, the Global Women's Marches, and
   \#Feminism4the99. The international forum Signs: A Journal of Women and
   Culture has urged feminist scholars to meet the moment by bridging
   academic and larger feminist publics and attending to creative, new
   feminist movements. This paper showcases one such example, surfeminism,
   a theory and action project working between publics of academia and
   global surfing. Surfeminism is a worldwide network connecting people,
   ideas, particular coastal geographies, online and real-time communities
   and microeconomies in surf industry, with activisms focused on protests
   of sexism in surf media, access to ocean spaces, environmental health,
   and women's racial, economic, and reproductive justice. The paper lays
   out surfeminist publics through discussion of the Institute for Women
   Surfers (IWS), a public humanities project in grassroots political
   education emphasizing relationships, cross-geography alliances, and
   critical thought. One of the more important and complex claims of
   surfeminism is for women and girls' leisure as a feminist political
   need. A discussion of leisure and its relation to authoritarianisms, as
   well as ideologies of so-called postfeminism closes the paper.},

Abstract = {This report discusses feminist and gender geographies in Ireland. We
   first focus on the ways in which gender constructs Irish geographies,
   updating numbers of women in academic positions across Ireland. This
   shows that women are increasingly in secure positions, but remain
   under-represented in more senior positions. We then turn to research. We
   discuss how femininities and women, and masculinities and men, have been
   addressed in Irish geographies. The focus on femininities and women is
   crucial given recent strides towards gender and reproductive justice. We
   then briefly summarise sexualities work. The report concludes by arguing
   that Ireland not only has vibrant gender/feminist geographical
   scholarship, it also has significant potential for emerging research and
   developing new theorisations and research agendas.},

Abstract = {This paper comes out of a panel honoring the work of Anne Donchin
   (1940-2014), which took place at the 2016 Congress of the International
   Network on Feminist Approaches to Bioethics (FAB) in Edinburgh. My
   general aim is to highlight the contributions Anne made to feminist
   bioethics, and to feminist reproductive ethics in particular. My more
   specific aim, however, is to have a kind of conversation with Anne,
   through her work, about whether reproductive justice could demand
   insurance coverage for in vitro fertilization. I quote liberally from
   Anne's work for this purpose, but also to shower the reader with her
   words, reminding those of us who knew her well what a wonderful
   colleague she was.},

Abstract = {This article considers the response of the Disability Royal Commission
   (the Commission) to the experiences of the estimated 21,000 Australian
   parents with intellectual disabilities and their children. Research
   shows that interlocking complex social disadvantage and ableist
   professional attitudes toward parenting by people with intellectual
   disabilities persist, leading to very high rates of child protection and
   child removal. The approach taken by the Commission to examination of
   violence, abuse, neglect, and exploitation against parents with
   disabilities as a group led to the invisibility of parents with
   intellectual disabilities within the Final Report. The life course
   approach was narrowly conceived and did not fully capture reproductive
   justice across the life course. The issue of parenting and child
   protection contact was primarily considered in relation to First Nations
   families, which brought critical attention to some aspects of systemic
   violence and abuse, but issues and experiences of non-Indigenous parents
   with intellectual disabilities were absent. We argue that these and
   other flaws prevented the Commission from making important
   recommendations in relation to legal and policy reform to uphold the
   rights of people with intellectual disabilities to become parents and to
   receive the support they need for parenting over the life course.},

Abstract = {We discuss reproductive justice in the context of Finland, a Nordic
   welfare state often considered as having achieved exceptionally high
   ethical standards in reproductive health and overall justice. Every now
   and then, however, this reproduction is interrupted by ghosts in the
   machine: the problems, past and present, of marginalised, racialised,
   and/or otherwise non-normative people whose presences provoke specific
   Finnish hauntings, seething presences of reproductive injustice that
   suggest something is to be done. Instead of offering data analysis, this
   article aims to envision transformative reproductive justice futures
   through processual, collaborative theory development. This study uses an
   intersectional lens to understand how interlocking systems of oppression
   shape our lived experiences through an interdisciplinary, ethical
   analysis that suggests that what is required to resolve such hauntings
   is moral vigilance and care for a consistent reproductive justice
   orientation in global solidarity. Specifically in Finland, it requires
   the willingness to disavow the imperative to protect Finnish whiteness
   and active and meaningful solidarity across differences. Building on
   Black feminist and queer thought, we urge queer white people who may be
   tempted to become enfolded by homonationalism to take a more
   encompassing view of reproductive justice for a more sustainable welfare
   state ethic.},

Abstract = {As concerns for reproductive rights continue to be debated across the
   United States, the June 24th, 2022, U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the
   Mississippi case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization that
   overturned Roe v. Wade essentially upended the disciplinary foundations
   and ethical underpinnings of helping professions. The Council on Social
   Work Education (CSWE) does not mandate the integration of reproductive
   justice content in social work education. And yet, threats to bodily
   autonomy burgeon across the United States prior to and after the
   dismantling of Roe v. Wade, affecting the populations social workers
   serve. The time has come to talk about, not around, reproductive justice
   in social work education as well as how social workers are being
   subverted from using their professional training and ethical commitment
   to clients. It is the intent of this article to explore approaches for
   safeguarding professional values and ethical principles during these
   sociopolitically tumultuous times.},

Title = {A reproductive justice analysis of Black motherwork},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FAMILY THEORY \& REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 31},
Abstract = {This paper examines how Black mothers have had each tenet of
   reproductive justice violated by state powers and institutions, how
   Black mothers have resisted these injustices, and how this struggle
   between reproductive oppression and resistance is critical to
   understanding the relevance of Black motherwork in intersectional
   theories in family science. I argue that applying a reproductive justice
   analysis to Black motherwork involves three key components: (a) the
   right to identify and engage with Black motherwork; (b) the right of
   empowerment to disengage (further) with Black motherwork; and (c) the
   right to perform Black motherwork in safe and survivable environments.
   This paper emphasizes that infringements on Black women's reproductive
   liberties happens beyond the site of the body, it expands into their
   homes, their neighborhoods, and even their educational spaces.},

Title = {LGBTQI Sexual Well-Being and Embodiment After Cancer: A Mixed-Methods
   Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SEX RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 28},
Abstract = {This study examined lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and
   intersex (LGBTQI) cancer patients' sexual well-being post-cancer, and
   the associations between sexual well-being and social support, physical
   concerns, distress, quality of life (QOL), and coping. We used a
   mixed-methods approach, including 430 surveys and 103 interviews,
   representing a range of tumor types, sexual and gender identities, age
   groups, and intersex status. The findings indicated that LGBTQI people
   with cancer experience declines in sexual well-being following cancer,
   which are associated with reduced QOL, greater physical concerns, and
   lower social support. The perceived helpfulness of coping mechanisms was
   associated with greater sexual well-being across genders, with cisgender
   men reporting the sharpest declines in sexual well-being and highest use
   of coping mechanisms. Across all groups, searching for information
   online was the most frequently used coping mechanism, with support
   groups and counseling the most under-utilized. Qualitative findings
   facilitated interpretation of these results, providing examples of ways
   in which cancer impacted sexual well-being and how physical changes
   influence sexual embodiment or desire to engage in sex. Concerns about
   reduced sexual desire and activity, associated with changes to breasts,
   vulva, vagina, penis, erectile dysfunction, incontinence, scarring, and
   stoma, reflect previous findings in the non-LGBTQI cancer population.
   Unique to this population are the impact of physical changes on LGBTQI
   embodiment, including disruption to sexual and gender identities, and
   feelings of disconnection from queer communities. Addressing LGBTQI
   sexual well-being within oncology healthcare is a matter of sexual and
   reproductive justice, for a population whose needs are often overlooked
   within cancer care.},

Title = {Good deeds or exploitation?: Queer parents working for private assisted
   reproductive technologies companies in urban China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF LESBIAN STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 18},
Abstract = {This article examines the interplay of queer reproduction and private
   assisted reproductive technologies (ART) companies in urban China. While
   same-sex marriage has not gained legal recognition in mainland China and
   childbirth outside heterosexual marriage has been restricted, queer
   parents who have children through ART have gradually become visible. ART
   has emerged as an ideal way for Chinese queer citizens to have children,
   though they are not legally permitted to use ART services in domestic
   hospitals. Consequently, an increasing number of queer intended parents
   turned to underground ART businesses, with some of them becoming
   salespeople or business owners themselves. My ethnographic analysis
   comes from fieldworks conducted in Guangdong province, China, from 2018
   to 2021. This paper shows that the legal and moral debates brought by
   queer people's use of ART are perceived differently among diverse gender
   and sexual groups in Chinese society. It founds that queer parents'
   participation in the ART industry has demonstrated the potential for
   queer forms of parenthood and family, while reinforcing stratified
   reproduction and gender inequalities. The tendency to reduce
   IVF/surrogacy to ``womb-for-rent{''} business among Chinese ART
   businesses continues to impact queer people's reproductive and parenting
   rights. This paper hopes to offer insights into queer reproductive
   justice and reproductive technologies across the globe.},

Abstract = {The promising results achieved in male hormonal contraceptive trials
   over the last decades suggest that new male contraceptives could hit the
   market soon. In shared decision-making counseling, couples and their
   healthcare provider collaborate to make decisions about contraception
   choices. This model of contraceptive counseling could aid men in taking
   responsibility for contraception and women in trusting their partners in
   family planning. The shared decision-making process in contraceptive
   counseling requires partners to provide input on their preferences,
   values, and desires, while healthcare professionals share medical
   knowledge and evidence-based information.It has been proven that this
   method leads to higher adherence and satisfaction. To ensure that
   contraceptive counseling is inclusive, fair, and supportive of different
   reproductive experiences and needs, it is crucial to incorporate the
   Reproductive Justice Framework into counseling.},

Abstract = {Across the so-called West, feminist storytelling positions reproductive
   justice and the often-twinned issue of women's place within the family
   as a progressive issue. This conveniently ignores the inherent
   contradictions of the existence of only limited access to abortion in
   many Western nations, as well as parallel histories of access to
   reproductive justice in non-Western countries. Postcolonial Ireland, as
   an apparently Western country with a renowned history of anti-feminist
   legislation, has existed as one of these contradictions. In this
   article, we examine Irish feminists' familial storytelling to reveal how
   they managed their contradictory position in a teleological narrative
   that positioned Western feminism as the epitome of progress. We adopt a
   comparative approach - looking at the lead up to the introduction of the
   Eighth Amendment of the Irish Constitution in 1983, which awarded the
   foetus constitutional rights, and then the high profile Repeal the 8th
   movement that successfully revoked that amendment in 2018 - to
   understand reproductive rights activists' changing uses of ``the
   family{''} to effect intergenerational and transnational solidarity.
   Applying Sara Ahmed's concept of ``sticky{''} emotions, we examine how
   feminists transformed ``the Irish family{''} from a site of coldness and
   despair to one of hope, dignity, humanity and happiness.},

Title = {Sexual and Reproductive Justice and Health Equity for LGBTQ+ Women},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF LESBIAN STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUN 17},
Abstract = {LGBTQ+ women have long been overlooked in sexual and reproductive health
   research. However, recent research has established that LGBTQ+ women
   have unique and specific needs that need to be addressed in order to
   improve effectiveness of sexual health education and practice with this
   historically and presently underserved population. Informed by a
   reproductive justice framework coupled with liberation psychology
   theory, this review discusses the current state of sexual and
   reproductive health and technologies among LGBTQ+ women. In particular,
   we focus on a range of HIV prevention and reproductive technologies and
   their use and promotion, including the internal condom, abortion, oral
   contraceptives, dapivirine ring, HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis,
   intrauterine device, and other less studied options, such as the
   contraceptive sponge. Grounded in an intersectional framing, this review
   acknowledges the intersecting systems of oppression that affect multiply
   marginalized women inequitably and disproportionately. A
   sociohistorical, critical lens is applied to acknowledge the
   well-documented racist origins of reproductive health technologies and
   ongoing coercive practices that have led to medical mistrust among
   marginalized and stigmatized communities, particularly racialized LGBTQ+
   women, women with disabilities, and women who are poor or incarcerated.
   Moreover, we discuss the urgent need to center LGBTQ+ women in research
   and clinical care, community-engaged health promotion efforts, affirming
   non-heteronormative sexual health education, and health policies that
   prioritize autonomy and dismantle structural barriers for this
   population. We conclude with recommendations and future directions in
   this area to remedy entrenched disparities in health.},

Abstract = {A foundation of rights-based solidarity has fostered an environment of
   cooperation between LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and
   queer) rights and reproductive justice in Northern Ireland (NI)
   following the introduction of equal marriage and the decriminalization
   of abortion in 2019. This article provides a grounded look at this
   reproductive justice organizing in NI as an example of transformative
   organizing for reproductive futures. The case study considers a
   conversation with two activists who have been central to this work. Emma
   Campbell coconvenor of Alliance for Choice and Danielle Roberts the
   coconvenor of Reclaim the Agenda and former Senior Policy and
   Development Officer of HERe NI. Reclaim the Agenda is a coalition of
   feminist, youth, LGBTQ+ and community organizations that connects and
   mobilizes women to promote feminist activism through education,
   campaigning and celebration. HERe NI is a community organization and
   registered charity based in Belfast that supports lesbian and bisexual
   women and their families across NI. Alliance for Choice campaigns for
   free, safe legal and local abortion access for everyone who needs it in
   NI. Together these groups approach reproductive justice using a
   framework informed by lesbian feminist organizing and an intersectional
   approach that views access to abortion as part of a broader
   understanding of gender justice inspired by Black-women led SisterSong
   through (1) cross-movement organizing (2) centering bodily autonomy and
   (3) trans affirming feminist approaches to navigating shifting language
   about gender. The case study will be of interest to those working
   provide abortion services in a queer-informed way, as well as those
   navigating the challenges of reforming abortion policy.},

Title = {Forced to Bear, Denied to Rear: The Cruelty of Dobbs for Disabled People},
Journal = {GEORGETOWN LAW JOURNAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {112},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1095-1159},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The history of the United States is marred by a shameful record of using
   reproduction to oppress disabled people through state-sanctioned
   legislation, policies, and programs that deprive them of their bodily
   autonomy and self-determination. Disabled people face structural, legal,
   and institutional barriers to accessing reproductive health services and
   information, including contraception and abortion care. They also
   experience high rates of violence and reproductive coercion, as well as
   stigma and discrimination from health providers. Consequently, people
   with disabilities are more likely to experience maternal morbidity and
   mortality, rendering pregnancy particularly dangerous for some. The
   Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision exacerbates this
   complex and challenging situation. Mounting abortion restrictions,
   coupled with the myriad barriers and challenges that people with
   disabilities already face, will result in some being forced to carry
   pregnancies to term even if they pose serious health risks or go against
   their wishes. Subsequently, should they choose to raise their children
   after childbirth, they will likely encounter ongoing threats to their
   parental rights because of laws, policies, and practices that assume
   incompetence among disabled parents. Thus, the ruling creates a paradox
   for disabled people where they may be forced to bear children but
   subsequently denied the opportunity to rear them, perpetuating a
   historical pattern of exploitation and subjugation. In response, this
   Article presents a nuanced and novel analysis of the Dobbs decision and
   its implications for people with disabilities. To do so, first, the
   Article examines the profound impact of forced pregnancy on disabled
   people, delving into the underlying reasons for high rates of unintended
   pregnancies among this group, including inaccessible reproductive health
   services and information, socioeconomic inequities, and violence and
   reproductive coercion. It also highlights the dangers and violations of
   bodily autonomy and self-determination that forced pregnancy entails for
   disabled people. Next, the Article's focus shifts to the denial of
   parental rights for people with disabilities, even after being compelled
   to bear children, exploring the societal, legal, and institutional
   obstacles that hinder their ability to parent, such as assumptions of
   incompetence, inadequate family support, constant surveillance and
   scrutiny, and ableism within the family policing system (also known as
   the child welfare system). Thereafter, it introduces the concept of
   disability reproductive justice and its relevance to these complex
   issues, providing a framework based on the principles of disability
   justice and reproductive justice to transform society into one that
   respects and supports disabled people's reproductive freedom. Finally,
   the Article proposes legal and policy solutions guided by the principles
   of disability reproductive justice to address the reproductive needs of
   disabled people and dismantle the systemic causes of reproductive
   oppression, emphasizing the necessity of a comprehensive approach
   considering the rising threat to reproductive freedom.},

Title = {Medication abortion for adolescents in the United States: Strengthening
   the role of pediatric primary care providers},

Abstract = {Background: Recent legal changes have led to mounting abortion
   restrictions in the United States (US), disproportionately impacting
   adolescents, who already face multifaceted barriers to abortion care.
   Informed by the framework of reproductive justice, adolescents who
   become pregnant deserve comprehensive, unbiased, and non-judgmental
   pregnancy options counseling, inclusive of all choices for pregnancy
   continuation and termination. Pediatric primary care providers are at
   the front lines of caring for adolescent patients' reproductive health
   needs and frequently diagnose pregnancy, provide pregnancy options
   counseling, and assist patients in accessing abortion care. They are
   uniquely poised to provide this care given their trusted, ongoing
   relationships with adolescent patients and their families, and their
   values of deep respect for adolescents' individuality and autonomy.
   Methods: In this commentary, we aim to describe the medical and legal
   landscape of adolescent abortion access in the US and provide
   recommendations to support pediatric primary care providers' involvement
   in abortion care. We focus on medication abortion, as the provision of
   medication abortion has the potential to encompass a broad group of
   clinicians, including pediatric primary care providers. Results: We
   discuss the importance of providing options counseling to adolescents
   within the reproductive justice framework, improving abortion education
   for pediatric providers, and expanding access to abortion care by
   supporting providers at an institutional level if they opt to provide
   medication abortions. Conclusion: In light of the current legal
   landscape, the role of pediatric primary care providers in ensuring
   adolescent access to abortion care is ever more critical. Although many
   pediatric and adolescent providers already provide this important care,
   we, a team of obstetricians/gynecologists and adolescent medicine
   physicians, echo prior calls for improved training and institutional
   support for pediatric providers to counsel about and provide
   abortion-related care. We hope that highlighting the role of pediatric
   providers in this sphere will help center the needs of adolescent
   patients and help them fulfill their family planning goals.},

Abstract = {Abortion is a ``public secret{''} in Latin America. It is highly
   restricted across most of the continent and yet millions of abortions
   take place every year. We use the sociological framework of ``strategic
   ignorance{''} to argue that convenient not knowing, erasure, and
   concealment simultaneously prevent and facilitate abortions in Latin
   America. By drawing on interviews with people involved in abortion
   activism and access across the continent, we examine three sets of
   actors: the state, abortion providers, and individuals seeking
   abortions. When wielded by the state, strategic ignorance reproduces the
   status quo of the criminalization of abortion; however, when wielded by
   abortion providers and individuals seeking abortions, it creates the
   conditions for ``clandestine{''} abortions to be procured without
   prosecution. Strategic ignorance is therefore mobilized by the powerful
   as well as the less powerful who are resisting state control of their
   fertility and reproductive lives.},

Title = {A scoping review: Forced/coerced sterilization as a socio-cultural risk
   factor for sexually transmitted HIV for older Black women},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 23},
Abstract = {Understanding socio-cultural factors that influence older (age 50 and
   up) Black women's risk for sexually transmitted HIV has often been
   absent from policies and programs. This scoping review asked: What does
   academic literature reveal about forced/coerced sterilization as a risk
   factor for older Black women who are disproportionately affected by
   sexually transmitted HIV? Using the Arksey and O'Malley scoping review
   methodology, the authors identified academic and gray literature
   published between 2000 and 2023. Of the 407 sources identified and
   screened, three articles met the criteria for inclusion. One study
   focused on birth control conspiracy beliefs, another focused on racial
   differences in Norplant use, and the third focused on the
   intergenerational transmission of mistrust of medical care that
   influences HIV prevention among Black Americans. The study findings
   suggest that because the link has not been made between socio-cultural
   factors that impact older Black women's reproductive health practices,
   further investigation is warranted.},

Abstract = {The recent Supreme Court ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health
   Organization endangers reproductive freedom, particularly for
   marginalized communities, including disabled people. Disability and
   health equity researchers possess unique insights into the needs and
   experiences of disabled people, making our involvement crucial in
   response to the Dobbs decision. Accordingly, guided by disability
   justice and reproductive justice principles, researchers should
   undertake disability-inclusive studies on the consequences of abortion
   restrictions, advocate for policy changes that uphold the reproductive
   autonomy of disabled people, and collaborate with disability-led
   movements advocating for reproductive freedom. Indeed, it is imperative
   for researchers to actively promote the inclusion and self-determination
   of disabled people regarding their reproductive health and wellbeing.
   Given the escalating threats to reproductive freedom and their profound
   impact on disabled people, there has never been a more pivotal moment
   for disability and health equity researchers to join the fight for
   reproductive justice.},

Abstract = {Perinatal mental health is gaining recognition as a key antecedent of
   adverse maternal and child outcomes as the United States experiences a
   maternal mortality and morbidity crisis. Recent policy efforts have
   attempted to mitigate adverse outcomes through legislation such as the
   Taskforce Recommending Improvements for Unaddressed of 2021 and
   postpartum coverage through Medicaid expansion. Even with progress,
   perinatal mental health policy continues to grapple with a basic truth:
   The United States lacks an overarching health care system capable of
   meeting the mental health care needs of perinatal people and their
   families. Moreover, the burden of undiagnosed and untreated perinatal
   mental health challenges remains greatest among racially minoritized
   populations, such as Black, Asian, and multiracial people. A broader
   understanding of perinatal mental health is needed, grounded in the
   tenets of reproductive justice. From this perspective, we articulate
   specific policies to meet perinatal mental health challenges and promote
   thriving for birthing people and their families.},

Journal = {NURSING INQUIRY},

Abstract = {Pregnancy and childbirth have become a dangerous journey for Black women
   as harrowing stories of death and near-death experiences resonate within
   Black communities. While the causes of pregnancy-related morbidity and
   mortality are well documented, little is known about how Black Canadian
   women feel protected from undesirable maternal health outcomes when
   accessing and receiving pregnancy and intrapartum care. This critical
   qualitative inquiry sheds light on Black women's perceived sense of
   safety in accessing pregnancy and intrapartum care. Twenty-four in-depth
   interviews were conducted with Black women who were pregnant or had
   given birth. Five interconnected themes were generated through thematic
   analysis: (1) There is a lot of prejudice towards us, (2) We are treated
   as sick bodies, (3) There is a lot of stereotypes towards us, (4) Our
   care is lacking in quality, and (5) We feel unsafe in the healthcare
   system. These themes highlight the perils faced by Black women accessing
   pregnancy and intrapartum care. The right to safe motherhood and
   equitable care for Black women should be a national priority in Canada
   to avert a looming crisis.},

   Applicants in the Rocky Mountain West},
Journal = {VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 5},
Abstract = {To explore the factors impacting abortion access for abortion fund
   clients, data from 816 applicants was analyzed using a summative content
   analysis approach. Nine relationship themes emerged for applicants who
   cited their partner as a significant factor in their abortion
   decision-making, including (a) power and control, (b) fear and safety
   concerns, (c) leaving the relationship, (d) barriers to accessing care,
   (e) sexual violence, (f) perpetration and victimization, (g) having an
   unsupportive partner, (h) being partnerless, and (i) having a supportive
   partner. Abortion funds are a potential resource for those experiencing
   intimate partner violence and can support survivors through confidential
   care and referrals.},

Abstract = {Building communities is one way to limit inequality in the global
   development process. In Indonesia, that principle can best be
   illustrated in the Hindu Balinese compound. But does discrimination
   against women, especially those of lower class and caste, fundamentally
   undermine the community? Feminists contend so, but what is the nature of
   the pressure on Balinese women? Why is this experienced? How could this
   discrimination be resolved? Drawing on a wider intersectional feminism,
   primary data from 72 people and thematic analysis, it seems both the
   reproductive and property rights of Balinese women are constrained. But
   ordinary Balinese women, activists, and intellectuals do not share the
   Western feminist case of dismantling communities for individual human
   rights. Instead, Balinese people largely advocate Hindu community
   alternatives, at the heart of which is strengthening the institution of
   `nyentana'. This alternative helps to decolonize ``gender,{''} and
   reproductive justice, while putting the case for studying social
   economics a bit more in development studies.},

Abstract = {Anti-Blackness and heteronormativity are the driving forces that
   determine access to reproductive healthcare and services in the United
   States, and the rate of Black birthing-related deaths continue to
   skyrocket. Still, there is a dearth of literature that includes the
   reproductive experiences of Black birthing people and their interactions
   with the healthcare system. This current study builds power with 10
   Black Queer birthing people (or Partners) by centering on their
   gestation-based storytelling within discourse about reproduction. By
   blending these Partners' self-examination of their lived experiences
   with gestation with health research, Black feminism, and researcher
   interpretation of their stories, this study reveals the unparalleled
   truths of Black Queer reproduction. Six thematic areas within the
   healthcare system as experienced by Partners are explored. Additionally,
   through this disruptive approach, this study identifies the lived and
   material needs that necessitate reproductive justice for all.},

Title = {Reconstructing a niche sociality during the postpartum period: A
   qualitative study about the experience of becoming a mother as an
   immigrant in Switzerland},
Journal = {SSM-MENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {5},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Epidemiological studies conducted in high-income countries have shown
   that immigrant mothers and their children suffer from an augmented
   morbidity and mortality, including with regard to their mental health.
   Drawing on the ``niche sociality{''} concept (Manning et al., 2023) as
   an analytic tool, our paper aims to analyze the postpartum experience of
   immigrant mothers in Switzerland as well as the circumstances to which
   these mothers connect their experience and often their distress. This
   qualitative study included semidirected interviews with immigrant
   mothers (n=20) and with the health and social care professionals who
   cared for them (n=26) as well as ethnographic observations. We conducted
   a thematic analysis and triangulated the data produced with mothers
   themselves and professionals. Immigrant mothers shared mixed feelings
   regarding their experience. They often lived their maternity while
   experiencing a gendered loneliness. As members of transnational
   families, they dearly missed their relatives living abroad. Their
   position as new mothers and as immigrant persons comprised complex
   sociomaterial ordeals related to their (un)employment, housing, and
   sociality. Drawing from their practice in the community, professionals'
   narratives completed mothers'. Professionals critiqued the unequal
   access to quality health care as well as the petty measures that
   interfered with mothers' and infants' safety that were taken by
   street-level bureaucrats (Lipsky, 2010 (1980)). Reflexive and engaging,
   mothers shared sensible and nuanced narratives about their experience
   and initiatives to rebuild their niche sociality.},

Abstract = {For over a century, abortion has been politically and socially
   contested, affecting people's lives through personal experience and/or
   public discourse. In the United States (US), abortion is sometimes
   exceptional-treated differently from other procedures, professions, and
   political issues-and sometimes an exemplar-an accessible example of a
   commonly occurring social, political, or personal phenomenon. It is, in
   other words, an excellent sociological case study. Yet the sociological
   literature on abortion is relatively thin. In this essay, we review
   research on abortion and opportunities for future sociological work in
   eight areas: gender; race; the body and embodiment; political economy;
   organizations, occupations, and work; medical sociology; law and
   society; and social movements. Sociologists have much to contribute to
   characterizing and understanding abortion, particularly following the
   2022 US Supreme Court decision overturning the constitutional right to
   abortion. The discipline also has much to learn from studying abortion
   as a case. With its multifaceted social and political status and
   intersections with key areas of sociological interest, abortion offers a
   generative case for advancing sociological concepts, subfields, and
   constructs. While not exhaustive, our review aims to spark interest and
   inquiry, showcasing how a topic that spurs strong opinions can also
   catalyze sociological insights.},

Title = {Navigating a maze: Midwives' identity response to the enactment of an
   abortion law in Chile},
Journal = {MIDWIFERY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {131},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background: Chilean midwives have been identified as essential for
   successfully implementing an abortion law, a practice which could
   potentially be understood as contradicting their central mission.
   Nevertheless, to date, there has been no investigation into how Chilean
   midwives have incorporated induced abortion care provision into their
   professional identity. Objective: To elucidate how Chilean midwives
   understand and provide abortion care and how they have (re) defined
   their professional identity to include induced abortion care. This
   article reports the findings of the second part of this aim. Methods:
   This study was underpinned by a constructivist grounded theory
   methodology informed by a reproductive justice and feminist perspective.
   Midwives from Chile who have cared for women undergoing abortion were
   invited to participate in the study. After purposive and theoretical
   sampling, fifteen midwives were recruited. Findings: Midwives' identity
   is woman-centred, with high value placed on their role protecting life.
   These two aspects of midwives' identity are in contradiction when
   providing abortion care. Midwives' identity results from and informs
   midwives' practice. Midwifery regulation influences both practice and
   identity. The model `Navigating a maze' explains the interaction of
   these three elements. Conclusion: Midwives' identity response to the
   enactment of the Chilean abortion law is an example of how professional
   identity must navigate regulation and practice to make sense of its
   purpose. In light of this study's findings, the current tension
   experienced in midwives' identity should be carefully attended to
   prevent adverse outcomes for midwives and the Chilean population.},

Abstract = {Now is a pivotal moment in the fight for reproductive health and justice
   internationally. Well-established research has recognized the benefits
   of comprehensive sexuality education for youth and adolescents-including
   vast reproductive health benefits, decreased interpersonal violence, and
   improvements on measures of academic success and well-being. Despite
   these established benefits, challenges to the implementation of
   culturally sensitive and holistically framed sexuality education are
   intensifying across the globe. The International Federation of
   Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stands firmly in its support of
   comprehensive sexuality education and re-emphasizes the importance of
   the implementation of scientifically accurate, age-appropriate,
   culturally relevant, and inclusive education. Successful implementation
   relies on active youth leadership, physician involvement, and a renewed
   focus on high-quality monitoring mechanisms to assess impact and
   accountability at all levels. Most importantly, future efforts to
   improve and scale comprehensive sexuality education must emphasize the
   importance of an inclusive curriculum that addresses previously
   marginalized youth, such as LGTBQ+ and disabled individuals, through a
   reproductive justice lens. FIGO commits, and encourages the
   international healthcare community, to provide continued advocacy for
   the rights to health, education, and equality, in order to achieve
   improvement in health outcomes for young people across the globe.},

Abstract = {The monumental reversal of Roe vs Wade dramatically impacted the
   landscape of reproductive healthcare access in the United States. The
   decision most significantly affects communities that historically have
   been and continue to be marginalized by systemic racism, classism, and
   ableism within the medical system. To minimize the harm of restrictive
   policies that have proliferated since the Supreme Court overturned Roe,
   it is incumbent on obstetrician -gynecologists to modify practice
   patterns to meet the pressing reproductive health needs of their
   patients and communities. Change will require crossdiscipline advocacy
   focused on advancing equity and supporting the framework of reproductive
   justice. Now, more than ever, obstetrician -gynecologists have a
   critical responsibility to implement new approaches to service delivery
   and education that will expand access to evidence -based, respectful,
   and person -centered family planning and early pregnancy care regardless
   of their practice location or subspecialty.},

Title = {Programs and practices that support pregnant people who use drugs'
   access to sexual and reproductive health care in Canada: a scoping
   review},
Journal = {BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH},

Abstract = {BackgroundPregnant people who use unregulated drugs (PPWUD) are at high
   risk of health complications yet experience a range of barriers to
   sexual and reproductive health care. Given that improving maternal
   health and access to reproductive health care are key targets
   underpinning the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), there is an urgent
   need to improve access to appropriate supports and services for this
   population. Little is known about what programs and practices exist to
   support PPWUD's access to sexual and reproductive health care. This
   scoping review aimed to identify the available literature on these
   programs and practices in Canada.MethodsA scoping review was conducted
   using JBI methodology and reported using PRISMA guidelines. Scholarly
   databases and grey literature sources were searched to identify
   literature published between 2016-2023 in English or French that
   discussed, defined, conceptualised, or evaluated programs and practices
   that support PPWUD's access to sexual and reproductive health care in
   Canada. Identified literature was screened using Covidence. Data were
   extracted from included texts, then analysed descriptively. Frequencies
   and key concepts were reported.ResultsA total of 71 articles were
   included, most of which were grey literature. Of the total, 46 unique
   programs were identified, as well as several useful practices. Most
   programs were in urban centres in Western Canada, and most programs
   offered holistic `wrap-around services.' Several programs delivered
   these services on-site or as `drop-in' programs with the support of
   staff with lived/living experience of substance use. Most frequent
   program outcomes included keeping parents and children together,
   improving connection to other services, and reducing substance use
   harms. Noted helpful practices included non-judgmental care and the use
   of harm-reduction strategies.ConclusionsSeveral programs and practices
   that support PPWUD exist in Canada, though few focus exclusively on
   sexual and reproductive health. There remain opportunities to improve
   access to programs, including expanding geographic availability and
   range of services. The review has clinical application by providing an
   overview of available programs that may support clinicians in
   identifying services for PPWUD. Future research should consider client
   perspectives and experiences of these programs.Review registration

Abstract = {PURPOSE Physically or psychologically distressing birth experiences can
   influence postpar-tum health, parenting efficacy, and future pregnancy
   plans. Communication deficits contrib-ute to negative birth experiences.
   This qualitative analysis explored themes related to com-munication and
   negative birth experiences among Black birthing people who experienced
   preterm birth. METHODS We conducted qualitative interviews with
   non-Hispanic Black, English language- proficient birthing people with
   Medicaid-insured preterm infants. Interviews were designed to explore
   experiences with health care access and well-being after birth.
   Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and coded following an
   integrated approach where we applied a priori codes and captured
   emergent themes from the data. RESULTS We interviewed 30 participants
   from October 2018 to July 2021. Median gesta-tional age at birth was 30
   weeks (range 22-36 weeks). Interviews occurred a median of 7 months
   postpartum (range 2-34 months). Themes emerged related to negative birth
   experi-ences and communication: (1) communication gaps during urgent or
   emergent intrapartum procedures contributed to negative birth
   experiences; (2) postpartum opportunities to share birth experiences,
   particularly with peers, sometimes mitigated the psychological
   conse-quences of negative birth experiences; (3) participants did not
   consistently discuss concerns about future pregnancy risk related to
   negative birth experiences with clinical teams. CONCLUSIONS Themes from
   this sample of Black birthing people who experienced preterm birth
   suggest 3 ways health systems might intervene to improve communication
   to mitigate the consequences of negative birth experiences. Improvement
   efforts in these areas may improve postpartum health, future pregnancy
   outcomes, and long-term health.},

Abstract = {The legal framework governing abortion in India is fundamentally a
   cis-heteropatriarchal structure, utilizing a punitive criminal justice
   system to control the bodies of pregnant individuals. Sections 312-318
   of the Indian Penal Code, along with the POCSO Act and the PCPNDT Act,
   compose this criminal framework, promoting state surveillance that
   intimidates abortion providers and seekers alike. Legal cases vividly
   illustrate the harmful ``chilling effect{''} on both healthcare
   providers and abortion seekers resulting from criminalization. The
   stigma linked to criminalized abortions constrains reproductive
   decisional autonomy compelling individuals to choose between safe but
   prosecutable procedures, unsafe abortions with health risks, or carrying
   undesired pregnancies to term. This disproportionately affects
   marginalized communities, underscoring the inadequacy of carceral
   approaches in addressing structural barriers to realisation of
   reproductive rights. Advocates call for complete decriminalization,
   pushing for a transition to a reproductive justice framework. The
   proposal to completely abolish penal provisions that govern forced
   abortions begets concerns about leaving marginalized pregnant persons
   who frequently experience forced abortions with no legal recourse. This
   feminist dilemma that ensues requires the adoption of decarceral,
   intersectional approaches that maintain structures of accountability,
   without posing any risk to the rights of marginalized pregnant persons.},

   Unmet Needs for Mental Health and Social Services in a National Cohort},

Abstract = {Introduction: Perinatal Mood and Anxiety Disorders (PMADs) are the most
   common complications during the perinatal period. There is limited
   understanding of the gaps between need and provision of comprehensive
   health services for childbearing people, especially among racialized
   populations.
   Methods: The Giving Voice to Mothers Study (GVtM; n=2700), led by a
   multistakeholder, Steering Council, captured experiences of engaging
   with perinatal services, including access, respectful care, and health
   systems' responsiveness across the United States. A patient-designed
   survey included variables to assess relationships between race, care
   provider type (midwife or doctor), and needs for psychosocial health
   services. We calculated summary statistics and tested for significant
   differences across racialized groups, subsequently reporting odds ratios
   (ORs) for each group.
   Results: Among all respondents, 11\% (n=274) reported unmet needs for
   social and mental health services. Indigenous women were three times as
   likely to have unmet needs for treatment for depression (OR {[}95\%
   confidence interval, CI]: 3.1 {[}1.5-6.5]) or mental health counseling
   (OR {[}95\% CI]: 2.8 {[}1.5-5.4]), followed by Black women (OR {[}95\%
   CI]: 1.8 {[}1.2-2.8] and 2.4 {[}1.7-3.4]). Odds of postpartum screening
   for PMAD were significantly lower for Latina women (OR {[}95\% CI]=0.6
   {[}0.4-0.8]). Those with midwife providers were significantly more
   likely to report screening for anxiety or depression (OR {[}95\%
   CI]=1.81 {[}1.45-2.23]) than those with physician providers.
   Discussion: We found significant unmet need for mental health screening
   and treatment in the United States. Our results confirm racial
   disparities in referrals to social services and highlight differences
   across provider types. We discuss barriers to the integration of
   assessments and interventions for PMAD into routine perinatal services.
   Implications: We propose incentivizing reimbursement schema for
   screening and treatment programs; for community-based organizations that
   provide mental health and social services; and for culture-centered
   midwife-led perinatal and birth centers. Addressing these gaps is
   essential to reproductive justice.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This work examines the flawed narrative linking ecological crises to
   overpopulation, with a focus on its impact on women in the Global South.
   The paper argues that this perspective enables control over women's
   bodies under the pretence of environmental concern, aligning with
   necropolitics and a new form of eugenics. It calls for a nuanced
   understanding of the effects of environmental crisis on women,
   advocating for a human-centred approach that elevates the experiences
   and rights of historically marginalized groups. The discussion includes
   a critical analysis of the Malthusian discourse, highlighting
   alternative views on food scarcity and the problematic nature of family
   planning initiatives. The paper promotes reproductive environmental
   justice, challenging the overpopulation narrative and underscoring the
   need for equitable and respectful solutions that support the rights and
   well-being of women in the Global South.},

Title = {Restrictive points of entry into abortion care in Ireland: a qualitative
   study of expectations and experiences with the service},
Journal = {SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH MATTERS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {This article focuses on access to early medical abortion care under
   Section 12 of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act
   2018, in Ireland and identifies existing barriers resulting from gaps in
   current policy design. The article draws primarily on qualitative
   interviews with 24 service users, 20 primary healthcare providers in the
   community and 27 key informants, including from grassroots groups that
   work with women from different migrant communities, to examine service
   users' experiences accessing early medical abortions on request up to 12
   weeks gestation. The interviews were part of a wider mixed-methods study
   from 2020-2021 examining the barriers and facilitators to the
   implementation of abortion policy in Ireland. Our findings highlight
   care seekers' experiences with the GP-led service provision, including
   delays, facing non-providers, the mandatory three-day waiting period,
   and oversubscribed women's health and family planning clinics. Our
   findings also highlight the compounding challenges for migrants and
   additional barriers posed by the geographical distribution of the
   service and the 12-week gestational limit. Finally, it focuses on the
   remaining challenges for racialised and other marginalised groups. In
   order to provide a ``thick description{''} of women's lives and the
   complexity of their experiences with abortion services in Ireland, we
   also present two narrative vignettes of service users, and their
   experiences with delays and navigating the healthcare system as
   migrants. To this effect, this article applies a reproductive justice
   framework to the results to highlight the compounding effects of these
   barriers on people located along multiple axes of social inequality.},

Abstract = {Like broader conservative movements, the pro-life movement in the United
   States has a fraught history regarding its alignment with White
   supremacy. Yet, the whiteness of the pro-life movement is often hidden
   behind the discourses of colorblind racism through the U.S. cultural
   moment. To uncover and deconstruct this supposed ``anti-racist{''}
   discourse, I study Evangelical women and their roles in the
   pro-life/anti-choice movement to explore their consequences on the
   narratives of abortion and reproductive health care from the 1970s to
   present. I conduct interviews and participant observation with
   self-described Evangelical pro-life women through ethnographic
   opportunities and events. In this study, I explore the intersectional
   issues of reproductive injustices through fieldwork and interviews with
   anti-choice women. These interviews and ethnographic data focus on a
   particular group of anti-choice organizers who prepare and oversee the
   logistics of this movement: pro-life women. How does it come to be that
   conservative women control the narratives of reproductive health care?
   How can ethnographic methods be utilized to unveil new information and
   knowledge surrounding the barriers to reproductive health care by the
   pro-life movement? I analyze this qualitative data to understand how the
   rhetoric of the pro-life/anti-choice movement invades the language of
   reproductive health in the United States and how a reproductive justice
   framework can begin to deconstruct this problematic flow.},

Abstract = {Legacies of racial capitalism and colonialism drive present day racial
   disparities in perinatal health outcomes. Climate change amplifies
   existing social inequalities associated with environmental exposures and
   reproductive health, of which BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and people of

   this article summarizes three examples of climate justice issues with
   reproductive healthcare outcomes: traffic related air pollution
   exposure, chemical exposures in personal care products and plastics, and
   natural disaster frequency. We advocate for incorporation of climate
   justice and environmental health impact into medical school curriculum,
   increased prenatal screening for environmental toxins, and physician
   engagement with local environmental issues.},

   Mobile health outreach programs are effective in delivering family
   planning services by increasing access to family planning services
   including expanding method choice, contributing to resilient healthcare
   models, and advancing reproductive justice.
   Mobile health outreach programs may be a reasonable, cost saving,
   person-centered alternative to delivering healthcare particularly when
   traditional systems are strained.
   Summary
   Mobile health outreach programs in family planning exist in the United
   States and globally. Current literature suggests that mobile and
   outreach programs are effective in increasing knowledge and access to
   family planning in part by expanding method choice. A mobile health
   outreach approach is a resilient model that is person-centered and lends
   itself well to empower patients to practice self-care. The findings and
   lessons learned may be helpful in guiding future mobile health outreach
   programs in family planning and other services conducive to an out of
   clinic model, particularly as a response to overburdened health systems.

Title = {Policy and practices shaping the delivery of health services to pregnant

Abstract = {In Kenya, the pregnancy rate of 15\% among adolescents aged 15-19 years
   is alarmingly high. Adolescent girls living in informal urban
   settlements are exposed to rapid socio-economic transitions and multiple
   intersecting health risks and may be particularly disadvantaged in
   accessing sexual reproductive health services. Understanding
   vulnerabilities and service-seeking behaviours from different
   perspectives is important in order to support the development and
   implementation of progressive policies and services that meet
   adolescents' unique needs within urban informal settlements. This study
   explored policy makers, community health service providers' and
   community members' perceptions of access to, and delivery of, sexual
   reproductive health services for pregnant adolescents in one informal
   urban settlement in Nairobi. We employed qualitative methods with
   respondents throughout the health system, purposively sampled by gender
   and diversity of roles. We conducted focus group discussions with
   community members (n = 2 female-only; n = 2 male-only), key informant
   interviews with policy makers (n = 8), traditional birth attendants (n =
   12), community health volunteers (CHVs) (n = 11), a nutritionist (n =
   1), social workers (n = 2) and clinical officers (n = 2). We analysed
   the data using thematic analysis. Government policies and strategies on
   sexual and reproductive health for adolescents exist in Kenya and there
   are examples of innovative and inclusive practice within facilities. Key
   factors that support the provision of services to pregnant adolescents
   include devolved governance, and effective collaboration and
   partnerships, including with CHVs. However, inadequate financing and
   medical supplies, human resource shortages and stigmatizing attitudes
   from health providers and communities, mean that pregnant adolescents
   from informal urban settlements often miss out on critical services. The
   provision of quality, youth-friendly reproductive health services for
   this group requires policies and practice that seek to achieve
   reproductive justice through centring the needs and realities of
   pregnant adolescents, acknowledging the complex and intersecting social
   inequities they face.},

Abstract = {Transgender and gender-nonconforming people remain excluded from women's
   health spaces, and nurses with expertise in women's health best serve
   their needs when they seek sexual, reproductive, gynecologic, or
   obstetric care. However, commentary regarding the term ``women{''} and
   exclusionary policies and behaviors in health care marginalize
   gender-nonconforming patients and contribute to health disparities.
   Therefore, the purpose of this article is twofold. First, we review
   terminology related to gender-nonconforming populations and their known
   health care needs; provide a brief historical overview of gender and
   health care; and describe the influence of White supremacist,
   misogynist, and heteronormative influences in women's health care.
   Second, we generate a call to action and specifically discuss the
   responsibilities of nurses and nursing organizations to ensure the
   provision of gender-equitable and respectful care and generate clinical
   recommendations for the specialty.},

Title = {Reproductive psychiatric advance directives: promoting autonomy for
   perinatal people with serious mental illness diagnoses},
Journal = {ARCHIVES OF WOMENS MENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 10},
Abstract = {People with serious mental illness (SMI) diagnoses who become pregnant
   are particularly vulnerable to symptom recurrence and resulting
   potential lack of decision-making capacity (Taylor et al. J Psychiatr
   Res 104:100-107, 2018; Bagadia et al. Int J Soc Psychiatry 66:792-798,
   2020). In these situations, prenatal and behavioral health providers
   have little legally viable guidance on what medical and/or psychiatric
   care the patient desires (Aneja and Arora Indian J Med Ethics V:133-139,
   2020). We created a ``Reproductive Psychiatric Advance Directive
   (PAD),{''} grounded in Reproductive Justice principles, that promotes
   patient autonomy by proactively articulating perinatal medical and
   psychiatric care preferences. We conducted a medical and legal
   literature review using two sets of terms related to (1) PADs and (2)
   reproductive health. We convened an expert working group of legal,
   medical, psychiatric, peer, and advocacy leaders and community-based
   organizations to develop a Reproductive PAD. Our literature review
   yielded no results about Reproductive PADs. We created de novo a
   Reproductive PAD template with sections on medical and psychiatric
   history, informed consent for critical medical and psychiatric care,
   family planning and custody preferences, and optional sections on
   abortion and on electroconvulsive therapy. The Reproductive PAD provides
   a possible legal mechanism for people of childbearing age with SMI
   diagnoses to articulate their medical and psychiatric care choices
   around reproduction and pregnancy. Future research should evaluate the
   Reproductive PAD as an effective tool for protecting patient autonomy
   during pregnancy and postpartum and guiding medical and psychiatric
   providers.},

Abstract = {Disparities in maternal morbidity and mortality remain vivid reminders
   of the role of racism in obstetrics and gynecology. If a serious attempt
   is to be made to purge medicine of its ongoing role in unequal care,
   then departments must commit the same intellectual and material
   resources as they would to the other health challenges in their remit. A
   division that understands the unique needs and complexities of the
   specialty, including translating theory into practice, is uniquely
   positioned to keep health equity as a focus of clinical care, education,
   research, and community engagement. To achieve reproductive justice, an
   approach addressing the intersectionality of race, ethnicity and gender
   identity is critical. In this article, we detailed the ways in which
   divisions of health equity within departments of obstetrics and
   gynecology can dismantle impediments to progress and can move our
   discipline closer to optimal and equitable care for all. We described
   the unique educational, clinical, research, and innovative
   community-based activities of these divisions.},

Title = {Reproductive justice advocacy efforts among genetic counselors and
   family planning providers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENETIC COUNSELING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {33},

Pages = {1015-1025},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Throughout all areas of medical practice, genetic counselors (GCs)
   occupy a key position in promoting patients' personal autonomy while
   facilitating informed medical decision-making. This professional
   position aligns with the concept of reproductive justice. Previous
   literature has attempted to define reproductive advocacy in medicine as
   well as the potential intersection of genetic counseling and
   reproductive justice advocacy work, yet limited data exist regarding
   GCs' perceptions of their role and involvement in reproductive justice
   advocacy work. This study aimed to identify the perceptions and actions
   of GCs regarding reproductive justice advocacy measures, as well as
   explore motivating factors influencing their attitudes and behaviors.
   Family planning providers, who tend to prioritize reproductive justice
   and advocacy, were surveyed to be a comparison group. We distributed an
   anonymous online survey within the National Society of Genetic
   Counselors (NSGC) and the Society of Family Planning (SFP) consisting of
   a 10-item personality inventory and Likert scale questions exploring
   characteristics and behaviors regarding reproductive justice advocacy.
   Results from 252 eligible respondents were analyzed using descriptive
   statistics, Chi-square, and Mann-Whitney U analyses. NSGC members are
   significantly less involved in several areas of reproductive justice
   advocacy, including regular participation in advocacy efforts when
   compared to SFP members (p = 0.04). The most cited barrier to NSGC
   members' participation was feeling unsure how to become involved, a
   significant difference compared to SFP members (p = 0.01). Findings from
   this study, undertaken in the final days of Roe v. Wade, suggest that
   GCs want to be more involved in reproductive justice advocacy but are
   uncertain where to begin. Intersociety collaboration and intra-society
   promotion of grassroots reproductive justice efforts may reduce this
   perceived barrier and others like it.},

Title = {Looking Back, Visioning Forward: Preconception Health in the US 2005 to
   2023},
Journal = {MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 21},
Abstract = {Preconception health has always been about preventative health care,
   ensuring the overall wellbeing of people of reproductive age before they
   have children. However, just as public health and health care have
   shifted to prioritize equity and include ideas about how social
   determinants of health influence health outcomes, the field of
   preconception health has experienced a similar transition. The purpose
   of this paper is to provide an overview of the evolution of
   preconception health in the United States after 2005, highlighting the
   key tensions that have shaped the field. We provide an overview of the
   early history of the movement and describe how four phases of
   ideological tensions overtime have led to changes across seven
   categories of preconception health: definitions and frameworks,
   surveillance and measurement, messaging and education, strategic
   convenings and collaborations, clinical practice, and reproductive life
   planning. We also describe the historic and emerging challenges that
   affect preconception care, including limited sustained investment and
   ongoing threats to reproductive health. The vision of preconception
   health care we outline has been created by a diversity of voices calling
   for wellness, equity, and reproductive justice to be the foundation to
   all preconception health work. This requires a focus on preconception
   health education that prioritizes bodily autonomy, not just pregnancy
   intentions; national surveillance and data measures that center equity;
   attention to mental health and overall well-being; and the inclusion of
   transgender and non-binary people of reproductive age.
   Preconception health is an important opportunity for improving the
   well-being of people of reproductive age and the health of any children
   they hope to have in the future. Learning from the foundational work of
   the past is essential as we look forward to advancing this work in the
   future.},

Abstract = {At the one-year mark since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, there is an
   urgent, vital need for feminist scholarship that addresses the ways
   structural stigma and oppressive policy affect diverse groups of women
   and people assigned female at birth (AFAB). Accordingly, in this
   introduction to the special issue of Psychology of Women Quarterly, we
   provide a historical overview and timeline of reproductive rights and
   (in)justice in the United States in order to illustrate how we have
   arrived at this perilous moment in history. Reproductive (in)justice
   exacerbates inequities regarding who has been encouraged to reproduce,
   who has been denied reproductive autonomy, and who has been required to
   reproduce and refused the right to parent their children in safe
   environments. Accordingly, we aver the importance of centering an
   intersectional and reproductive justice framework in understanding how
   coalescing forms of oppression (e.g., racism, capitalism, sexism,
   ableism) circumscribe reproductive autonomy. We begin the special issue
   with articles that examine how social policy and structural oppression
   have violated women's and people AFAB reproductive healthcare, followed
   by articles that examine how such policy and oppression affect women's
   reproductive decision-making. We conclude this special issue with an
   article that centers reproductive justice advocacy in the ongoing fight
   for reproductive rights and bodily autonomy.},

Title = {Shared Futures or Financialized Futures: Polygenic Screening,
   Reproductive Justice, and the Radical Charge of Collective Care},
Journal = {SIGNS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {49},
Number = {1},
Pages = {209-235},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Polygenic screening is a new form of embryo testing that assesses the
   probability that an embryo will later develop a wide range of health
   conditions. This technology purports to help prospective parents choose
   which embryos to implant during in-vitro fertilization to ensure the
   ``healthiest{''} baby. In this essay, we interrogate polygenic screening
   as part of the broader economy of finance capital-backed fertility
   technologies that are redefining notions of care to stress individual
   risk mitigation and neo-eugenic genetic selection as a way to promote
   the ableist mirage of ``healthy{''} futures for generations to come.
   Contesting these false promises, our essay reveals the
   political-economic interests that lurk behind this problematic notion of
   care, juxtaposing it with an alternative vision of collective care by
   engaging radical Black, Indigenous, and socialist feminist calls for
   reproductive justice, mutual aid, and the revaluation and reorganization
   of reproductive labor. We argue that the embrace of polygenic screening
   obfuscates the political roots of our crisis of reproductive labor and
   care-an obfuscation that also silences the ecological precarity upon
   which the settler state is predicated. We thus bring neoliberal,
   eugenic, and ultimately settler colonial ideologies of privatized care
   into stark relief with an alternative that will more likely open up
   futures for all of our children and kin. Foregrounding radical
   collective approaches to care repoliticizes discussions of
   maternal/parental care; it also points to the necessary political
   movement building required if we are to cherish and protect the lives of
   current and future generations, the planet, and all its inhabitants.},

   psychoanalytic political praxis. This engages a Black feminist
   commitment to reproductive justice, a more expansive frame for politics
   that can embrace intersectional aims across a range of policy issues
   connected to the human right to have or to not have children, in a
   social and political context that supports the common good and
   facilitates human and environmental flourishing. In doing so, I
   highlight psychoanalysis's somewhat hidden history of political
   commitment and engagement, particularly in terms of the interpersonal
   approach. I argue that only a sustained commitment from progressive
   forces, including among those in psychoanalysis, can forestall the
   further encroachment of authoritarian, anti-democratic forces operating
   in the US.},

Abstract = {After considerable progress in recent decades, maternal mortality and
   morbidity (MMM) either stagnated or worsened in most regions of the
   globe between 2016 and 2020. The world should be outraged given that we
   have known the key interventions necessary for preventing MMM for over
   threequarters of a century. Since the 1990s, human rights advocacy on
   MMM has gained crucial ground, demonstrating that entitlements related
   to maternal health are judicially enforceable and delineating
   rights-based approaches to health in the context of MMM. Nonetheless,
   evident retrogressions, coupled with ballooning social inequalities,
   redoubled austerity post-pandemic, and a conservative populist backlash
   against reproductive rights, underscore the steep challenges we face.
   This paper offers five lessons gleaned from what we have achieved during
   the past 30 years of human rights advocacy on maternal health, and where
   we have fallen short: (1) maternal health is not a technical challenge
   alone and is inseparable from reproductive justice; (2) reproductive
   justice requires strengthening health system infrastructures; (3) we
   must center the political economy of global health in our advocacy, not
   just national policies; (4) litigation is part of a larger advocacy
   toolkit, not a go-it-alone strategy; and (5) we must use metrics that
   tell us why women are dying and what to do.},

Abstract = {In this study I explore discourses of contraception and reproduction,
   which are drawn upon and reproduced in Swedish official online sources
   on contraceptive advice, through the theoretical frameworks of
   biomedicalization and reproductive justice. The analysis yielded three
   interwoven themes: 1) women in need of contraceptives have to balance
   discourses of exogenous hormones as both an ``unnatural{''} threat to
   their bodies and as desirable, effective regulators of the same
   ``naturally unruly{''} body; 2) in search of a ``perfect contraceptive
   fit{''}, it is the woman who needs to accommodate to available methods,
   rather than the other way around; 3) women are made discursively
   invisible, while simultaneously being constructed as individually
   responsible for reproduction. Underpinning all these themes is the
   discourse of rational, responsible choices, of exerting agency by
   choosing the right contraceptive. In the era of biomedicalization,
   finding a ``contraceptive fit{''} becomes a moral and gendered health
   practice demanding thorough self-surveillance. The rational woman,
   exercising control over her reproduction and body, by planning her
   pregnancy with safe contraceptives, emerges as the only possible
   position. Recognizing that women's and fertile person's reproductive
   choices are made amid a societal context, with differing personal
   resources and experiences, would bring us even closer to reproductive
   justice.},

Title = {An assessment of postpartum contraception rates with evolving care
   during the COVID-19 pandemic},
Journal = {SEXUAL \& REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {36},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic presented new care delivery obstacles
   in the form of scheduling procedures and safe presentation to in-person
   visits. Contraception provision is an indispensable component of
   postpartum care that was not immune to these challenges. Given the
   barriers to care during the initial months of the pandemic, we sought to
   examine how postpartum contraception, sterilization, and visit
   attendance were affected during this period. Study Design. We performed
   a retrospective chart review to examine contraception initiation,
   sterilization, and postpartum virtual and in-person visit attendance
   rates during the first six months (March 15 to September 7, 2020) of the
   COVID-19 pandemic compared to the rates in the same period in the year
   prior at a single tertiary academic care center. We abstracted data from
   the first prenatal visit through twelve weeks postpartum. Results: With
   the initiation of virtual appointments, postpartum visit attendance
   significantly increased (94.6 \% vs 88.4 \%, p < 0.001) during the
   pandemic with no difference in overall contraception uptake (51 \% vs
   54.1 \%, p = 0.2) or sterilization (11.0 \% vs 11.5 \%, p = 0.88).
   During the pandemic, contraception prescribed differed significantly
   with a trend towards patient-administered methods including pills,
   patches, and rings (21 \% vs 16 \%, p = 0.02). In both periods, there
   was a significantly younger mean age (p < 0.001), higher proportion of
   nonWhite and non-Asian race (p < 0.001), public insurance (p = 0.003,
   0.004), and an established contraceptive plan prenatally (p < 0.001) in
   the group that received contraception. Conclusion: As virtual postpartum
   visits were instituted, contraception initiation and sterilization were
   maintained at pre-pandemic rates and visit attendance rose despite the
   obstacles to care presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Provision of
   virtual postpartum visits may be a driver to maintain contraception and
   sterilization rates at a time, such as early in the COVID-19 pandemic,
   when patient care is at risk to be disrupted by social distancing,
   isolation, and avoidance of medical campuses.},

Title = {Victims of eugenic sterilisation in Utah: cohort demographics and
   estimate of living survivors},
Journal = {LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH-AMERICAS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {19},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background Eugenicists at the beginning of the twentieth century feared
   that the ``unfit{''} were outbreeding the ``fit{''} and promoted
   interventions like sterilisation as a solution to the perceived problem.
   Over 60,000 people were sterilised across the United States, victims of
   eugenic programs implemented in 32 states. Utah had a particularly
   aggressive eugenic sterilisation program, hailed by eugenicists for
   sterilising such a large proportion of its population, and lasting well
   into the 1970s. The goal of the present study was to determine who, at
   the demographic level, was targeted by this eugenic practice in Utah,
   and to also estimate how many survivors of the program might still be
   alive in 2023. Methods We used archival records and data abstracted from
   charts at the Utah State Developmental Center to construct an
   observational cohort of people sterilised under Utah's coercive, eugenic
   sterilisation program. We described the demographics of the cohort and
   presented a life table analysis to estimate the number of survivors
   still living in 2023. Findings At least 830 men, women, and children
   (modal age of 15-19, 53.6\% female) were sterilised in Utah
   in-stitutions under a program that was launched in 1925, peaked in the
   1940s, and concluded in the 1970s. The life table analysis predicts
   approximately 54 survivors (36 women, 18 men), with an average age of
   78. Interpretation Many people sterilised under Utah's eugenics law are
   likely living today. While some states have taken steps to reckon with
   their roles in depriving people of their reproductive rights, Utah lacks
   even an official acknowledgment of this shameful, medical history. Given
   the advanced age of the potential survivors, time is running out for a
   reconciliation that can be experienced by those who were most harmed by
   the practice. Health 2023;19: Published February https://doi.org/10.

Abstract = {BackgroundIndividuals with substance use disorders (SUD) have
   disproportionately high rates of unintended pregnancy. Reducing harm
   associated with this risk and its biopsychosocial consequences requires
   evidence-based, non-coercive interventions that ensure access to
   contraception for individuals who choose to prevent pregnancy. We
   examined feasibility and impact of SexHealth Mobile, a mobile unit-based
   intervention that aimed to increase access to patient-centered
   contraceptive care for individuals in SUD recovery programs.MethodsWe
   conducted a quasi-experimental study (enhanced usual care {[}EUC]
   followed by intervention) at three recovery centers with participants (n
   = 98) at risk for unintended pregnancy. EUC participants were offered
   printed information on community locations where they could access
   contraception care. SexHealth Mobile participants were offered same-day,
   onsite clinical consultation on a medical mobile unit and contraception
   if desired. The primary outcome was use of contraception (hormonal or
   intrauterine device) at one-month post-enrollment. Secondary outcomes
   were at two-weeks and three-months. Confidence in preventing unintended
   pregnancy, reasons for non-use of contraception at follow-up, and
   intervention feasibility were also assessed.ResultsParticipants (median
   age = 31, range 19-40) enrolled in the intervention period were almost
   10 times more likely to be using contraception at one-month (51.5\%)
   versus the those enrolled in the EUC period (5.4\%) (unadjusted relative
   risk {[}URR] = 9.3 {[}95\%CI: 2.3-37.1]; adjusted relative risk {[}ARR]
   = 9.8 {[}95\%CI: 2.4-39.2]). Intervention participants were also more
   likely to be using contraception at 2-weeks (38.7\% vs. 2.6\%; URR =
   14.3 {[}95\%CI: 2.0-104.1]) and three-months (40.9\% vs. 13.9\%; URR =
   2.9 {[}95\% CI: 1.1-7.4]). EUC participants reported more barriers
   (cost, time) and less confidence in preventing unintended pregnancies.
   Mixed-methods feasibility data indicated high acceptability and feasible
   integration into recovery settings.ConclusionsMobile contraceptive care
   based on principles of reproductive justice and harm reduction reduces
   access barriers, is feasible to implement in SUD recovery settings, and
   increases contraception use. Expanding interventions like SexHealth
   Mobile may help reduce harm from unintended pregnancies among
   individuals in SUD recovery.Trial Registration NCT04227145.},

Abstract = {Various scholars have concluded that narratives of individuals who have
   ended wanted pregnancies restrict abortion to only acceptable cases.
   Through the analysis of 33 personal narratives posted on the website
   ``Ending a Wanted Pregnancy,{''} this article argues, that these stories
   are polysemous, exhibiting hermeneutic depth. Women telling these
   stories construct reproductive justice and anti-abortion meanings
   simultaneously, which creates a new meaning in which their terminations
   are not abortions and removes them from the abortion dichotomy. These
   narratives achieve this distinction through the construction of a
   termination narrative and by distinguishing themselves from women who
   (do not) have abortions.},

   experiences and engagement of pregnant and parenting youth (PPY)
   attending an alternative school in Chicago and the sorts of
   instructional approaches and activities that can promote their social

   Participatory Action Research (YPAR) and ethnographic methods involving
   a team of African American and Latinx PPY in designing and implementing
   research projects and media campaigns aimed at better understanding the
   experiences of young parents.This study found that PPY gained valuable
   knowledge and skills from their participation in engagement and advocacy
   projects in which they had opportunities to address issues relevant to
   their lives and communities. This study hopes to inform the development
   and implementation of services and initiatives for PPY and to help
   reimagine possibilities for PPY's role in advocacy and activism on
   behalf of themselves and their children.},

Title = {Romani Girls Matter: Developing a Participatory Action Research Protocol
   for Reproductive Justice},
Journal = {HEALTHCARE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Despite the last few decades' advances towards social and gender
   justice, reproductive decisions are still a source of oppression for
   many European Romani women and girls. This protocol aims to propose a
   model to empower Romani women and girls' reproductive decisions,
   inspired by Reproductive Justice-the recognition of women and girls'
   ability to make safe and free decisions about their bodies and
   reproduction. Through Participatory Action Research, 15-20 Romani girls
   and their families, two Romani platforms, and key agents from a rural
   and an urban context in Spain will participate. They will (1)
   contextualize Romani women and girls' inequities, (2) build
   partnerships, (3) implement Photovoice and advocate for their gender
   rights, and (4) assess the initiative's related changes, using
   self-evaluation techniques. Qualitative and quantitative indicators will
   be collected to assess impacts among participants, while tailoring and
   assuring the quality of the actions. Expected outcomes include the
   creation and consolidation of new social networks, and the promotion of
   Romani women and girls' leadership. For this, Romani organizations must
   be transformed into empowering settings for their communities, spaces
   where Romani women and girls assume responsibility of the initiatives,
   being these tailored to their real needs and interests, and guaranteeing
   transformative social changes.},

Title = {Provider perspectives on patient-centered contraceptive counseling for
   Latinas in Baltimore, MD},
Journal = {CONTRACEPTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {119},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Objectives: To explore: 1) provider narratives of their contraceptive
   counseling practices with Latina pa-tients within the context of
   patient-centered care (PCC); and 2) provider perceptions about the
   barriers to the provision of patient-centered contraceptive counseling
   in general and more specifically, with Latina patients in Baltimore,
   MD.Study Design: We conducted 25 semistructured qualitative interviews
   with physicians and nurse practi-tioners from four specialties who
   provide contraceptive care to Latinas in Baltimore, MD. We analyzed data
   using directed content analysis. We discuss findings with attention to
   major constructs of PCC, ap-plying a reproductive justice
   framework.Results: Providers described a contraceptive counseling
   approach focused on pregnancy prevention as the primary goal. Most
   respondents used a tiered-effectiveness approach, even while noting the
   importance of PCC. Providers noted health system barriers to PCC,
   including time constraints and insurance status. Provider-reported
   patient-attributed barriers included low patient education/health
   literacy, culturally -attributed misconceptions about contraception, and
   language discordance. Conclusion: Providers described knowledge of and
   intention to practice PCC but had limited integration of it in their own
   counseling with Latinas. Responses suggest tension between an expressed
   desire to provide PCC and paternalistic counseling paradigms that
   prioritize pregnancy prevention over patient preferences. Inequitable
   health system barriers also interfere with true implementation of
   contraceptive PCC.Implications: Translating contraceptive PCC into
   practice, especially for marginalized communities, is paramount.
   Training should teach clinicians to recognize systems of structural
   inequity and discrimina-tion that have informed approaches to counseling
   but are not reflective of PCC. Institutional policies must address
   health system barriers that also hamper PCC.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

   systems thinking to inform action},
Journal = {HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH},

Volume = {58},

Abstract = {Objective (Study Question)To use systems thinking with diverse system
   actors to (a) characterize current problems at the intersection of
   chronic conditions (CCs) and reproductive health (RH) care and their
   determinants, (b) determine necessary system actors for change, and (c)
   document cross-system actions that can improve identified problems in
   the United States. Data Sources/Study SettingData were collected from
   six groups of system actors via online focus groups. Study DesignThis is
   a qualitative multilevel study using the iceberg systems thinking
   framework. Data Collection/Extraction MethodsData were collected by
   note-taking and recording six focus groups; analysis incorporated
   perspective triangulation using the systems thinking iceberg and system
   mapping to visualize interconnected system challenges, actors, and
   action ideas. Principal FindingsParticipants described eight necessary
   system actors: health care institutions, medical leaders, medical
   providers, patient advocates and foundations, patients and families,
   payors, policy makers, and research funders. Forty pain points were
   identified, spread across each of the four levels of the systems
   thinking iceberg: undesirable outcomes (6), concerning trends (9),
   system structure flaws (15), and problematic mental models (10). In
   response to these pain points, a set of 46 action ideas was generated by
   participants and mapped into nine action themes: (1) adjust QI metrics,
   incentives, and reimbursement, (2) bolster RH medical education and
   training, (3) break down medical silos, (4) enrich patient education,
   (5) expand the health care team, (6) improve holistic health care, (7)
   modify research and programmatic funding to prioritize RH and CC, (8)
   spur innovation for patient visits, and (9) support professional
   champions and leaders. ConclusionsBy embracing system complexity,
   creating visual maps, and pushing participants to identify actionable
   strategies for improvement, this study generates a set of specific
   actions that can be used to address pain points across the multiple
   system levels that make improving reproductive care for people with CCs
   so challenging.},

Abstract = {In this defining moments essay, I take up feminist new materialist and
   reproductive justice theories to explore communication, autonomy,
   consent, and in/justice in the context of pelvic exams. I use feminist
   new materialism and reproductive justice to illustrate the ways in which
   traditional medical education practices, histories of misogynoir,
   speculums, patient gowns, and more communicate and matter in pelvic exam
   teaching and practice. In so doing, I move between academic prose and
   short narratives drawn from my lived experiences as both a patient and a
   Gynecological Teaching Associate (a role in which I instruct medical
   students learning to perform pelvic exams). Ultimately, I argue that
   attending to influence of other-than-humans and adopting relational
   conceptions of agency can help health communication scholars and
   practitioners advance equity and justice in pelvic exams.},

Title = {Reading for refusal in UK maternity care: entangling struggles for

Journal = {FENNIA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY},

Abstract = {Research has shown that women with insecure immigration statuses in the
   United Kingdom (UK) are more likely to register later in their pregnancy
   with National Health Service (NHS) maternity care providers. This late
   engagement with healthcare services is framed in academic debates as one
   of the key reasons for poor outcomes for these women and their children
   during and after birth. Interventions, therefore, have focused on how to
   remove barriers to accessing maternity care for these women. In this
   paper, we argue that this approach fails to account for the agency of
   the women adequately, which needs to be understood in the context of
   state harms and violence towards women with insecure immigration
   statuses and, in particular, their reproductive lives.We seek to shift
   these debates by framing this lack of early engagement with
   state-provided maternity services as a form of refusal that denotes an
   active disengagement by bordered women from intersecting structures of
   harm and oppression that are embedded in the UK's National Health
   Service, particularly through the charging regime. We argue that the
   politics of refusal in this case are embedded in struggles not only for
   border but also reproductive justice. Drawing on participant observation
   and data from secondary sources, we illustrate how refusal of early
   antenatal care opens pathways for bordered women to seek the care-ful
   conditions they need and want during pregnancy.},

Abstract = {This article argues that state laws banning abortions for disability
   violate reproductive justice for parents with disabilities. These bans
   deprive people with disabilities of choices that may be important to
   their possibilities of becoming parents, including possibilities for
   abortion of pregnancies that have become risky to continue. Far from
   protecting disability civil rights, these state law bans restrict the
   abilities of people with disabilities to choose to have children and to
   parent.},

Abstract = {Settler colonialism has contributed to disproportionate reproductive
   health disparities for Indigenous people, however the majority of
   literature surrounding pregnancy, centers the experiences of White
   individuals. This paper uses data from a qualitative study exploring
   reproductive health of Indigenous persons from a United States Gulf
   Coast tribe to elucidate the pregnancy experiences of 31 tribal members.
   In interviews, participants described how and from whom they learned
   about pregnancy and birth, their experiences with miscarriage and
   complications during pregnancy, working during pregnancy and lack of
   post-partum or maternity leave, and generational changes in pregnancy.
   These findings highlight the impact of previous reproductive experiences
   and family support during pregnancy for women from this tribe. The data
   also draws attention to the importance of paid leave in the postpartum
   period and provides an example of collaborative research methods with
   Indigenous communities.},

   explore student experiences of an on-campus crisis pregnancy centre
   (CPC), drawing on data from a small mixed methods study. Participants
   contacting the CPC sought testing, counselling, and referral to
   abortion; instead, they encoun-tered religious, anti-choice messages,
   and were left distressed and with delayed access to health care. These
   findings underscore the imperative that campuses provide accessible
   sexual and reproductive health services while simultaneously limiting
   campus access to anti-choice organizations.},

Abstract = {Starting from the premise that the reproductive rights agenda
   constitutes a range of political disputes in the field of sexuality and
   reproduction, this article examines the debate held at the public
   hearing on the Argument of Noncompliance with a Fundamental Precept
   (ADPF in the Portuguese acronym) No. 442, which took place in August
   2018. This lawsuit proposes the decriminalization of abortion induced by
   the pregnant woman herself or with her consent, until the 12th. week of
   gestation. At the hearing convened by the Supreme Court, 50 amici curiae
   presentations were held, catalyzing the current arguments raised in the
   public debate on abortion in Brazil. The content of the public hearing
   (characters, places, images, audios, texts, and video) is taken as
   empirical material for this research. Considering the centrality of the
   defense of life/combating death argument, both in speeches for and
   against ADPF, we examine the different frameworks used by political
   actors on the scene, when debating the issue of abortion in terms of a
   clash between death and life. More than a polysemy of terms, it is a
   clash that makes explicit hierarchies regarding reproduction and women's
   lives.},

Title = {Specter(s) of Care: A Symposium on Midwifery, Relationality, and
   Reproductive Justice To-Come},
Journal = {FRONTIERS-A JOURNAL OF WOMEN STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {44},
Number = {2},
Pages = {98-123},
Abstract = {Nearly twenty -five thousand years ago, Plato wrote a symposium about
   love. This symposium was attended by Socrates, the founder of
   ``maieutic{''} philosophy, a name owing to the comparison of his
   profession to that of his mother, a maia, meaning midwife in ancient
   Greek. By now, the kind of relational continuity of care that midwifery
   could have represented in ancient times, is something that we have long
   lost, if we ever had it. In most medical institutions, relational care
   is but a specter haunting us: something that we long for but is refused
   to us on account of it being a practical and material impossibility. The
   symposium below, written twenty -five thousand years later, is an
   attempt to reconceive of care for fertility, abortion, pregnancy, and
   parenthood. Through a combination of hauntology, critical fabulation,
   and decolonial empirical methodology (Rhee 2021; Gordon 2007; Hartman
   2019), a specter of care is staged in the figure of midwife Phaenarete,
   Socrates' mother, who is engaged in dialogue with current day midwives
   and mothers. Following Derrida (2006), there is only one reason to
   ``talk{''} to a specter, namely if it is for a justice to-come. This
   notion of the ``to-come{''} is taken seriously as the horizon of
   reproductive justice, invoking a direct poetics of opacity, receptivity,
   and creolization (Glissant 2010; 2020a; 2020b) in order to imagine
   relational care that can ensure reproductive justice for all.},

Abstract = {In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, some US state governments
   banned abortion due to its allegedly `elective' nature. While these
   actions were successfully challenged in courts, discussion about the
   topic may have shaped personal and public opinion. This study aimed to
   explore the framing of abortion in local newspapers during the onset of
   the pandemic. Articles regarding abortion were collected from three top
   circulated local online news publications from three southern US states.
   Of the states that attempted to block abortions, Alabama, Louisiana and
   Mississippi were selected for their high non-White populations. Using
   critical thematic analysis, 77 articles were analysed, and four themes
   were identified: individual-centric, public health risk, interplay with
   inequalities, and hierarchical health care. Existing abortion narratives
   were taken up by different sides of the debate to push political
   agendas. However, new pro-/anti-abortion justifications were observed,
   specifically regarding public health concerns during COVID-19.
   Anti-abortion activists framed abortion provision as a health risk and
   employed other narratives that likely reinforced gendered, ethnic and
   socioeconomic power disparities by shifting blame onto abortion seekers
   and providers. However, pro-choice supporters framed abortion as
   essential health care and as a structural issue, which may have
   bolstered awareness for structural change.},

Abstract = {Physician advocates for sexual and reproductive health (SRH) care have
   been active in the United States for decades. Despite such activism,
   access to SRH services has been fraught with persistent restrictions,
   particularly for abortion care. We sought the perspectives of key
   stakeholders on what makes for an effective SRH physician advocate and
   thoughts about the successes, failures, and needs of the abortion
   advocacy movement. We interviewed 15 SRH key informants (KIs) in sectors
   with expertise in organizational policy and advocacy (n = 6); clinical
   leadership and education (n = 3), media (n = 3), and reproductive
   justice (n = 3). The analytic team coded repeating ideas and conducted a
   thematic analysis, organizing findings within KI perspectives on the
   role of physician advocates in the field of abortion and contraception;
   successes, failures, and needs in abortion and contraception advocacy;
   and recommendations on the composition and components of an ideal
   clinician advocacy training program. KIs relayed that skill building
   related to communication, developing relationships with changemakers,
   and understanding political systems was critical for effective advocacy.
   They felt clinician advocacy training programs should include providers
   other than physicians and be designed for trainees to build
   relationships with one another over time. KI perspectives can be
   valuable in informing advocacy training programs and for contributing
   strategic approaches to increasing equitable and widespread access to
   SRH services.},

Abstract = {This paper reconsiders Tommie Shelby's (2016) analysis of procreation in
   poor black communities. I identify three conceptual frames within which
   Shelby situates his analysis-feminization, choice-as-control, and
   moralization. I argue that these frames should be rejected on
   conceptual, empirical, and moral grounds. As I show, this framing
   engenders a flawed understanding of poor black women's procreative
   lives. I propose an alternative framework for reconceiving the
   relationship between poverty and procreative justice, one oriented
   around reproductive flourishing instead of reproductive responsibility.
   More generally, the paper develops a methodological challenge for
   nonideal moral and political philosophy, especially concerning the
   obligations of the oppressed. Specifically, I argue that in the absence
   of descriptive and conceptual accountability, the moral gaze of the
   philosopher risks preserving, rather than destabilizing, oppressive
   ideologies.},

Abstract = {Prior to and since the 2022 Dobbs decision, U.S. state laws have
   endorsed individuals surveilling and punishing those associated with
   abortion care. This practice presents an urgent need to understand the
   characteristics of abortion stigma, particularly the perspectives of
   individuals with stigmatizing beliefs. To examine the concept and
   characteristics of abortion stigma, we interviewed 55 individuals about
   whether they thought there should be consequences for getting an
   abortion and, if so, what the consequences should be. Adults from three
   states (Michigan, Kansas, and Arizona) were purposively sampled to
   include a range of abortion identities and levels of religious
   engagement. We used reflexive thematic analysis to code and interpret
   the data. Participants imagined consequences including financial
   penalties, incarceration, and forced sterilization. Three themes
   highlighted how abortion was described as violating the law, women's
   gender roles, and religious doctrine; accordingly, abortion was imagined
   as deserving of negative consequences, although abortion was legal in
   all states during data collection. We argue that these imagined
   consequences relied on carceral logics and interconnected sexist,
   racist, and classist stereotypes that reflect and reproduce abortion
   stigma. This study deepens the understanding of abortion stigma from the
   perspective of the stigmatizer, underscoring the danger of legislation
   grounded in stigmatizing beliefs.},

Abstract = {How do settler colonialism, control of women's and differently gendered
   bodies, sex, industry, pollution-but also pleasure, love, care, desire,
   bodily autonomy, and survival- cleave together and apart in the inland
   wetland of Windermere Basin park? Starting with this question, this
   article explores my own attraction to this tiny place in postindustrial
   and settler colonial Hamilton, Ontario. I am curious about what it can
   teach us about the complex entan-glements of these things, and the toxic
   desires that are both enabled and foreclosed by the relations that
   gather here. In the first section, I briefly rehearse the basin's toxic
   history and, guided by Audre Lorde's definition of erotics and Catriona
   Sandilands formative work on queer ecologies, my own desirous
   attachments to the life it nonetheless sustains. The next section
   reveals how, in the context of settler colonialism and climate
   catastrophe, these erotics are queerly tangled in questions of
   more-than-human gender, sex, and reproduction, too, in ways that invite
   a capacious and multivalent understanding of reproductive justice. The
   final section examines the performance art of white settler ecosexuals
   Annie Sprinkle and Beth Stephens, but sets this alongside a performance
   by Vanessa Dion Fletcher at Windermere, in order to in-sist on a version
   of ecosexual erotics that, while joyous, remains imbricated in fraught
   histo-ries, complicity, and an inalienable attention to what Michif
   scholar Max Liboiron parses as ``differences and obligations.{''} Taking
   a cue from settler feminist artist and scholar Lindsay Kel-ley, I refer
   to this as ``bad ecosex.{''} In its refusal of purity, bad ecosex holds
   the trouble of con-temporary ecological relations together with the
   pleasurable power of erotics to build a politics of change grounded in
   feeling deeply.},

Abstract = {This essay examines the interplay between systems of gendered violence
   and reproductive injustice especially as they exist within frameworks of
   public and private spheres of knowledge/ experience. I suggest that like
   domestic violence, abortion care is often articulated as a private issue
   in need of public support and resources. This framing undercuts the
   systemic operation of power and control at the cultural level that
   sustains intersectional violence against people who are already most
   vulnerable under neocolonial/ hetero-patriarchal/ white supremacist/
   capitalist oppression. As feminist activists in the U.S. lament the fall
   of Roe v. Wade, we ought to use the exigence of the Dobbs decision to
   collectively demand more robust access to reproductive justice by
   centering the intersectional experiences of people for whom abortion
   care in the U.S. has never been meaningfully accessible.},

Abstract = {This paper highlights the value of an Environmental Reproductive Justice
   framework in social work and argues that environmental justice and
   reproductive justice should not be approached as two distinct issues.
   Because social work is a human right and social justice focused
   profession, it is uniquely poised to simultaneously address
   environmental justice issues impacting reproductive health and
   wellbeing. An Environmental Reproductive Justice framework centers
   Intersectionality to address sociopolitical issues at the intersection
   of environmental and reproductive concerns. We offer examples of
   organizations utilizing Environmental Reproductive Justice approaches,
   whether implicitly or explicitly. We conclude with implications for
   social work education and practice.},

Abstract = {Transgender and gender non-conforming individuals have historically
   experienced discrimination accessing reproductive rights. This
   transcends into the ways in which the current systems of healthcare are
   structured to continue perpetuating the marginalization of this
   population of gender diverse persons, specifically as it relates to
   reproductive care. Throughout this paper, we will utilize a reproductive
   justice framework to explore ways in which transgender patients
   experience discrimination in unique ways through micro- and
   macroaggressions within the healthcare system based on the intersection
   of the reproductive healthcare services in which they are seeking,
   paying special attention to pregnancy and postpartum care, and their
   unique social identity. This paper will conclude with specific
   recommendations for how medical family therapists can impact healthcare
   systems by integrating trauma-informed care aligned with a reproductive
   justice framework.},

Abstract = {Psychology of Women Quarterly (PWQ) is a leading outlet for feminist
   psychology research. To elucidate the interrelations of PWQ publications
   over time, we conducted a citation network analysis of its 2,747
   articles and 4,517 citation links. Of the 16 citation clusters that
   emerged, many echoed key elements of PWQ's scope. These included Cluster
   1: feminist consciousness and sexism; Cluster 2: body image and
   objectification; Cluster 3: feminist psychology, epistemology, and
   methodology; Cluster 4: gender and educational and occupational
   experiences; Cluster 5: rape and sexual assault; Cluster 6: power and
   violence in close relationships; Cluster 7: sexual harassment and
   workplace discrimination; and Cluster 8: women and power with attention
   to race and nation. Areas of citation disconnection revealed avenues for
   resisting citation silos and advancing pantheoretical feminist
   frameworks on the continuum of patriarchal violence. Small and
   discontinued clusters were areas ripe for feminist revisiting (e.g.,
   reproductive justice). PWQ articles were cited in an increasing number
   and breadth of journals over time. These findings can inform authors,
   reviewers, and editors to advance the next decades of scholarship in PWQ
   in ways that resist citation silos, revive research on critical domains
   of women's lives, and foster the feminist edge of our scholarship.},

Abstract = {The Women's National Abortion Action Coalition organized for abortion
   rights, an end to forced sterilization, and accessible birth control.
   From its formation in July 1971 to its demise with the January 1973 Roe
   v. Wade decision, it was an inclusive, far-reaching network that
   spearheaded the call for reproductive justice. Assembling a coalition,
   including high school and college students and those who called
   themselves Third World women (Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Native
   American women), the group held marches, protests, and in the fall of
   1972 abortion tribunals across the country, holding men in power
   accountable for the oppression of women.},

Abstract = {This article argues that the detention and inhumane treatment of
   pregnant migrants by the United States (US) immigration authorities
   forms part of a continuum of gendered necropolitical violence that
   frames migrants' lives before, during, and after crossing the US-Mexico
   border. In this context, pregnancy - a uniquely gendered and embodied
   experience - is a rich site of analysis, a place where reproductive
   oppression is enacted on individual bodies as well as reproduced in
   rhetoric that criminalizes pregnant migrant women. This article brings
   together two streams of analysis by feminists of color: first, the
   analysis by Latin American feminists of the ``war against women's
   bodies{''} in the current phase of narcocapitalism and necrocapitalism
   in Mexico and Central America; and second, the analysis by scholars of
   gendered immigration enforcement ({''}crimmigration{''}) and
   reproductive oppression in the US. This transfeminist approach brings
   the US reproductive justice movement into conversation with a Latin
   American feminist critique of gendered necropolitics in the Americas,
   pointing the way toward a radical politics of embodied personhood and
   reproductive autonomy.},

Abstract = {With the enactment of the Abortion Legislation Act 2020, New Zealand
   radically transformed its approach to abortion. Abortion is no longer a
   crime, and is instead regulated under general health law, adopting a
   gestational model. Whilst some claim that reform was overdue, critics
   have described the new legislation as the `world's most extreme abortion
   law'. This article investigates these claims through the lens of
   reproductive justice, a movement that emerged alongside the global
   campaign for recognition of reproductive rights. First, it outlines the
   tenets of reproductive justice, before critiquing New Zealand's previous
   law, and considering arguments for its modernisation. It then describes
   how a growing number of jurisdictions have decriminalised abortion, with
   increasing pressure on other countries, including England and Wales, to
   similarly undertake law reform. Finally, it examines the main provisions
   of New Zealand's law. It concludes that, to the extent that the new law
   enables access to timely, equitable, and publicly funded abortion
   services, it is consistent with the tenets of reproductive justice. By
   placing women at the centre of the law, it improves the welfare of
   women, but particularly marginalised women. However, it suggests that
   the current 20-week gestational test is arbitrary, with the originally
   proposed 22-week threshold preferable.},

Title = {Precarious reproductive citizenship: gaps in employment protections for
   pregnant precarious status migrants in Canada},

Abstract = {Understandings of citizenship have increasingly come to include the
   recognition of family care and reproduction as practices of citizenship
   and a recognition that migrants who are not citizens nonetheless engage
   in many practices of citizenship within their host state and rely on
   their host state for the fulfilment of basic human rights. This paper
   conceptualizes this intersection of immigration and reproduction as
   precarious reproductive citizenship, arguing that gaps in entitlements
   for pregnant precarious status migrants constitute reproductive
   injustice and present an important challenge for how we understand
   citizenship and human rights. This conceptualization is illustrated
   through interviews with women concerning their experiences of pregnancy
   and new motherhood while having precarious immigration status living in
   Montreal, Canada. It highlights three employment-related policies:
   employment discrimination protections, maternity and parental leave, and
   childcare. In each case, immigration status (directly or indirectly)
   acts as a barrier to accessing protections and programs meant to support
   gender equity and overall family thriving.},

Title = {Contraceptive use and consistency and the role of deferred action for
   childhood arrivals: A cross-sectional survey of undocumented young
   adults},
Journal = {SEXUAL \& REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objective: The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program
   grants young, undocumented immigrants work authorization and protections
   from deportation, with about 1.3 million eligible for the program. This
   exploratory study examines the association between DACA status and
   contraceptive use among undocumented young adults. Study design: We
   conducted an internet-based survey between June 2017 and August 2017
   among Asian and Latinx undocumented immigrants (N = 204) aged 18-31
   years in California. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions
   were conducted to examine the associations between DACA status and
   contraceptive use and consistency. Results: Among undocumented
   participants who were sexually active, about 60\% reported having
   unprotected sex (52\% DACA vs. 63\% non-DACA) and about 80\% reported
   that documentation status affects how they access care for
   sexual/reproductive health at least a little. Overall, Asians were 81\%
   less likely to have unprotected sex compared to Latinx individuals (aOR
   = 0.19, 95\%CI: 0.06, 0.56). DACA recipients were more likely to report
   using contraception every time compared to non-recipients (42.9\% vs.
   30.5\%, p = 0.04). DACA recipients were 63\% less likely to report
   having unprotected sex in the past 12 months compared to those without
   DACA (aOR = 0.37, 95\%CI: 0.14, 0.99). DACA recipients were more than
   three times as likely to use contraception during sex every time
   compared to those without DACA (aOR = 3.19, 95\%CI: 1.19, 8.54).
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that undocumented young adults have
   low rates of contraceptive use; however, DACA is associated with
   improved reproductive health for certain undocumented immigrants.
   Implications and contribution: State and federal policies that extend
   protections and promote immigrant integration are needed to fully
   achieve reproductive justice for all.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Maternal morbidity and mortality rates are on the rise in
   the United States, particularly among Black populations. Recently, there
   has been an uptick in research funding to identify and address root
   causes, particularly among at-risk groups. However, given the historical
   trauma experienced by Black populations in research settings, novel
   approaches built firmly on ethical principles and grounded in a
   framework of reproductive justice are necessary to minimize harm and
   center the research process on maintaining the dignity and respect of
   research participants. Methods: Ethical principles as outlined by the
   American Nurses Association, Black Mamas Matter Alliance, and federal
   research guidelines are reviewed within the context of conducting
   maternal mortality-focused research. In addition, community developed
   research frameworks and methodologies are presented and discussed within
   the research context. Conclusions: Black pregnant people have reported
   mistreatment during clinical encounters; therefore, intentional
   protections to promote safety must be considered in the research
   setting. Ethical principles must be considered when designing and
   implementing research initiatives focused on addressing maternal
   mortality risk in Black communities.},

Title = {Assisted reproduction technologies and reproductive justice in the

Abstract = {This article examines the construction of parenthood, drawing on
   Brazilian cisgender, heterosexual, and homosexual couples' experiences
   in using assisted reproduction technologies (ART), particularly the
   surrogacy. For that purpose, we interviewed: 1) a lesbian woman who had
   her daughter through her partner's pregnancy, using ART with anonymous
   donor semen; 2) a gay man who, together with his partner, used a
   surrogacy service under contract via a specialised offshore agency; 3) a
   woman who was a surrogate, in Brazil, for her sister-in-law and brother
   who lived abroad and, from abroad, sent an embryo fertilised for
   surrogacy; 4) a woman who resorted to her sister-in-law in order to be a
   mother by surrogacy, with ovules from the woman herself fertilised with
   semen from her husband; and 5) the sister-in-law mentioned in 4), who
   acted as surrogate for her brother and his wife. These interviews made
   it possible to think about the discursive construction of the legitimacy
   of such parenthoods, as it is produced by access to, and manipulation
   and circulation of, reproductive technologies and persons. This
   biomedical management of bodies sets up a material and discursive
   circuit that, in turn, produces a complex web of personal, normative,
   legal, professional and market relationships, particularly with a view
   to construction of a parenthood anchored in a notion of
   biologically-constituted origin. In this respect, biological, affective
   and social bonds merge to produce a precise placement of who is the
   father and/or who is the mother, as well as who are the important others
   and how they are linked to the child in a broader web of parenthood.},

Abstract = {Many contemporary ethical debates turn on claims about the nature and
   extent of our alleged procreative moral rights: moral rights to
   procreate or not to procreate as we choose. In this article, I argue
   that there are no procreative moral rights, in that generally we do not
   have a distinctive moral right to procreate or not to procreate as we
   choose. However, interference with our procreative choices usually
   violates our nonprocreative moral rights, such as our moral rights to
   bodily autonomy or to privacy. My argument presents hypothetical cases
   in which a state interferes with a person's procreative choices in order
   to promote aggregate social welfare, but this interference does not
   violate any of the person's nonprocreative moral rights. These cases not
   only undermine frequently made claims that widely recognized
   nonprocreative moral rights entail procreative moral rights, they also
   challenge the intuitively plausible claim that interference with our
   procreative choices as such violates our moral rights. What at first
   appear to be substantive moral rights are in fact a kind of illusion
   created by the frequent overlap of other rights, but lacking in
   substance beyond that overlap. While this argument against the existence
   of procreative moral rights has substantive implications for ongoing
   debates in reproductive ethics, I ultimately suggest that it is
   consistent with a progressive approach to reproductive justice.},

Abstract = {There is growing scholarly and public attention toward the stark racial
   disparities in birth outcomes in the US. To lower disparate rates of
   Indigenous and Black infant mortality rates and maternal mortality
   rates, public and elected officials have proposed extending
   comprehensive prenatal care and medical resources and addressing racial
   biases in healthcare delivery. These efforts aim to bring minoritized
   and marginalized peoples and communities ``into the fold.{''} In this
   essay, I consider the potential dangers of such contemporary efforts by
   critically analyzing historical initiatives to address birth outcomes
   and reproductive health in Indigenous communities. By foregrounding
   settler colonial social orders and their links to settler capitalism, I
   show how historical efforts to bring Indigenous peoples ``into the
   fold{''} jeopardized Indigenous birth and reproductive capacities, while
   also upholding heteropatriarchal notions of sexuality, family, and
   racial difference.},

Abstract = {Despite Illinois' progress in the area of reproductive health, Black,
   Indigenous, and People of Color, young people, and people with low
   resources face persistent barriers to high-quality contraceptive care
   and experience inequities in reproductive health outcomes. Illinois
   Contraceptive Access Now (ICAN!) is a 5-year initiative that aims to
   improve the quality and coverage of contraceptive care at community
   health centers statewide. By leveraging state policies, a robust
   community health infrastructure, digital innovation, and with a focus on
   sustainability, ICAN! seeks to cut the ``contraceptive coverage gap{''}
   in Illinois in half by 2025. As Illinois democratizes access to
   contraceptive care, this initiative can serve as a model for advancing
   reproductive equity nationwide. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Purpose of Review This review describes lessons learned from longer
   acting contraception and employs a reproductive justice lens to inform
   expansion of emerging HIV prevention technologies. Recent Findings
   Reproductive justice is a framework that advocates for the promotion of
   universal sexual and reproductive freedoms, particularly among
   historically marginalized communities. This framework takes a holistic
   view of individuals and sees the interconnections between sexual health,
   reproductive health, and overall health. Employing a sexual and
   reproductive justice perspective is essential to understanding and
   helping to mitigate the role intersecting structural, sexual, and
   reproductive oppressions, including those demonstrated through promotion
   of longer acting contraception, and can critically inform rollout of
   future prevention technologies, such as longer acting HIV pre-exposure
   prophylaxis. This review highlights the need for researchers,
   clinicians, and policymakers to apply lessons learned from contraception
   and specifically focuses on principles of reproductive justice to offer
   expanding HIV prevention options.},

Abstract = {Background: Over 100 million women make decisions about beginning or
   resuming contraception after childbirth annually. The burden of an
   unplanned pregnancy is not equally distributed among racial and ethnic
   groups in the United States based on the rates of unplanned pregnancies.
   Objective: This article discusses the disparity in the utilization of
   contraception among Black women through a reproductive justice lens.
   Results: The reasons for these differences include a lack of access to
   care, and differences in contraceptive failure rates among racial and
   ethnic groups, as well as less of an inclination to have an abortion.
   Barriers to contraception for breastfeeding persons include patient
   medical conditions and concerns, and resistance by other health care
   providers due to language and cultural differences, and knowledge
   asymmetry. Institutionalized racism, transphobia, and homophobia may
   compromise patient access to the full spectrum of contraceptive options
   available. Conclusions: Given the individual and public health benefits
   of breastfeeding and the impact those benefits can have in helping Black
   birthing persons and children achieve health equity, it is important for
   obstetric and pediatric health care providers to play their part in
   encouraging and supporting breastfeeding.},

Abstract = {Contemporary young feminists (in South Africa) are claiming and
   proclaiming reproductive agency, often through public social media
   discourses and popular activist sentiments. Key features are expressions
   of embodied warfare via the female reproductive organs, talk of an
   agentic uterus that periodically `tries to kill' its host, and emphatic
   descriptions of violent modes of relation. This article aims to
   recognise that reproductive violences play out not only in the material
   inequities of everyday life and sexual and reproductive health/care, but
   also in the language practices of social collectivities, where
   discursive practices and norms can make or unmake, injure, negate and
   erase, or affirm and transform subjectivities. Proceeding from an
   examination of the discursive contexts in which dominant societal
   (hetero)norms may enact sexual and reproductive violences, I explore a
   broadened recognition of reproductive violence that engages with
   discursive arenas, namely the intimate public (Berlant 2008). My
   analysis shows that the discursive work done in the examined public is
   vital for feminist cultural production of new imaginaries of gendered
   and community life, and what it means to be co-imbricated in feminist
   social reproduction. I conclude the analysis with a gesture to feminist
   engagement on mutually desirable notions of reproductive justice while
   attending sufficiently to unexpected forms of reproductive violence.},

Title = {Are we listening? Obstetric anesthesiology and the national call for
   birth justice and accountability: a perspective from the United States},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBSTETRIC ANESTHESIA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {46},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Despite declining rates of pregnancy-related deaths worldwide, the
   United States (US) has seen an increase in maternal mortality. It is
   widely known that this increased risk of mortality impacts unevenly
   Black people, who are three-fold more likely to die from
   pregnancy-related causes than white people. This disparity in maternal
   mortality and morbidity is not unique to the US; countries like Brazil,
   the Netherlands, South Africa, and the United Kingdom (UK) report
   similar racial disparities in peripartum health outcomes. It is thought
   that many factors contribute to this tragic health inequity, including,
   but not limited to, structural racism, provider implicit bias, and lack
   of access to high quality, culturally humble reproductive health care.
   On July 25, 2020, activists for reproductive justice and birth justice
   published an open call in the New York Times entitled ``How many Black,
   Brown, and Indigenous people have to die giving birth? National call for
   birth justice and accountability.{''} It is a powerful statement that
   uses an intersectional framework to understand reproductive inequities,
   while making demands for positive healthcare reforms and radically
   dreaming of a reality where the struggle for reproductive justice has
   been actualized. Using personal narrative, this paper reflects on the
   field of obstetric anesthesiology and how clinicians can make meaningful
   change to address and eventually help solve this health care inequity.},

Abstract = {This study aims to bring reproductive justice issues to a more in-depth
   discussion within the field of social work and to explore social work
   students' understandings and perspectives on these important issues. An
   extensive qualitative analysis of 90 academic, published, peer-reviewed
   articles on the topic of reproductive justice was completed. The 20
   major findings and emergent themes were identified using the
   conventional content analysis approach and formatted in order to be used
   as the foundation for developing the survey questionnaire. This
   questionnaire was then utilized to explore 123 university students'
   perspectives on normative expectations regarding childbearing and
   reproduction. Findings indicated that those across the gender spectrum
   had similar levels of awareness of these expectations, demonstrating
   that personal experiences are not necessarily a prerequisite for
   awareness. Other identity markers like age, socioeconomic status, and
   parenting status did have some impact. Therefore, positionality and
   intersectionality do appear to play a role.},

Abstract = {Through the analysis of government actions during the response to the
   Covid-19 pandemic related to sexual and reproductive rights, this
   article reflects on the Brazilian government's neglect of women's
   health, especially in relation to users of the country's unified health
   system, violating the principles enshrined in the constitution. The
   pandemic has particularly affected populations who have been
   historically excluded by various forms of oppression and subjugation.
   The findings highlight the slackening of sexual and reproductive health
   care, which can result in unplanned pregnancy, unsafe abortion and
   maternal death, worsening the social conditions of a large segment of
   the population. By articulating the social markers of difference and the
   principle of social justice, it is argued that theoretical contributions
   from the field of black feminism, namely intersectionality and
   reproductive justice, can help understand social inequalities and
   promote collective resistance to the dismantling of the country's health
   policies.},

Title = {Creating Response-Able Futures? Discussing the Conservative Laestadian
   Desire to Mother within Reproductive Justice},
Journal = {GENEALOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article discusses the Conservative Laestadian women's desire to
   mother and the procreational ethos of the Conservative Laestadian
   religious movement in the framework of reproductive justice and
   ecological crisis. The data draws from my doctoral study in which I
   examined the aspirations of women who belonged in the Conservative
   Laestadian religious revival movement in Finland. In my attempt to
   understand the Laestadian women's desire to mother within the
   procreational ethos of this conservative religion, and to form an
   alternative approach to the issue in feminist ethico-ecological
   framework, I employ Donna J. Haraway's concept of response-ability
   together with Bracha L. Ettinger's theory of matrixial feminine
   transconnectivity. With this article, I propose that in their
   multivocality, diversity, and intertwined nature, the Laestadian women's
   accounts of motherhood assist in understanding the many aspirations,
   intentions, agencies, and a ffects that operate within the desire to
   mother in this conservative religious movement. The Laestadian women's
   diverging accounts enable us to consider motherhood as a manifold issue
   for a pious woman: a natural duty and an obligation, but also a position
   through which to claim the status of a subject. This invites us to think
   of the Laestadian women's desire to mother more broadly as an entangled
   ethics of relationality, care, and kin-making beyond human reproduction.
   To promote a response-able approach to the issue of the desire to mother
   on the edge of the ecological disaster, we must address the unquestioned
   transgenerational and procreational models of motherhood and how these
   complicate the discussion on the reproductive rights of religious female
   subjects in the Western world. However, as the desire to mother extends
   toward shared response-ability and more inclusive futures, it requires
   questioning the human desire to reproduce.},

Abstract = {In recognition of the 100(th)anniversary of women's suffrage, we
   reviewed the difficulties reformists overcame in passing the 19th
   Amendment and discuss the similarities to current challenges in
   providing evidence-based, affordable, accessible women's health care.
   Many current health care problems arise from systemic, not medical,
   issues, and we can better focus on them through the lenses of the social
   determinants of health and reproductive justice. Addressing systemic
   inadequacies and injustices requires policy implementation and
   legislative activism, like that pursued by the suffragists. We propose
   that, ultimately, voting is our professional, fundamental duty to make
   the desired changes. We then present advocacy avenues and opportunities
   available to all women's health care specialists.},

Abstract = {During global health crises, different narratives regarding infectious
   disease epidemics circulate in traditional media (e.g. news agencies,
   television channels) and social media. Our study investigated the
   narratives related to sexual transmission of Zika virus that circulated
   on Twitter during a public health emergency and analyzed the
   relationship between information on Twitter and on traditional media. We
   examined 10,748 tweets posted during the peaks of Twitter activity
   between January and March 2016. Posts in English, Spanish, French, and
   Portuguese and websites linked to tweets were manually reviewed and
   analyzed thematically. During the study period, there were three peaks
   of Twitter activity related to the sexual transmission of Zika. Most
   tweets in the first peak (n = 412) had humorous/sarcastic content
   (55\%). Most tweets in the second and third peaks (n = 5,154 and n =
   5,182, respectively) disseminated information (>93\%). Across languages,
   textual and visual content on the websites were predominantly placed
   online by traditional media and highlighted epidemiological narratives
   published by public health agencies, with little or no mention of the
   concerns or experiences of individuals most affected by Zika.
   Prioritising epidemiological/clinical aspects of epidemics may have a
   depoliticising effect and contribute to overlooking socio-economic
   determinants of the Zika epidemic and issues related to reproductive
   justice.},

Abstract = {Using a feminist hermeneutic, Autumn Reinhardt-Simpson attempts to set
   out in this article how a third- or fourth-wave intersectional reading
   of the stories of Hagar and Sarah and Leah, Rachel, and their maids can
   become a source of both truth and healing within feminist activist
   communities today, particularly those working for reproductive justice.
   Reinhardt-Simpson identifies several issues within the stories such as
   societal acceptance of women who seek power only within patriarchal
   constructs or to benefit the aims of patriarchy, as well as issues that
   divide women both then and today such as class, race, and status and the
   way that women relate to each other within a patriarchal structure.
   Reinhardt-Simpson concludes that a liberatory reading of these stories
   can point us toward reconciliation with our sisters.},

Title = {FROM BOOM TO A BAN: TRANSNATIONAL COMMERCIAL SURROGACY IN INDIA},
Journal = {REVISTA GENERAL DE DERECHO CONSTITUCIONAL},
Year = {2020},
Number = {31},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In Aug 2015, India imposed a ban on transnational commercial surrogacy,
   restricting it to heterosexual Indian couples who have been married for
   five years, have no existing children, and are able to persuade a
   relative to become a surrogate altruistically for them. This ban and the
   2016 Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill is expected to be endorsed as law in
   2019. The Bill, in effect, clamps down on the multi-billion-dollar
   industry involving over 3000 clinics. This paper analyses the rationale
   and outcomes of the restrictive ban on the industry of commercial
   surrogacy. In the first few sections I unpack the implications of the
   2016 Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill and proposed ban on commercial
   surrogacy and situate it within national imperatives as well as a global
   political context. I use data from my decade-long ethnographic work in
   surrogacy clinics in India, together with the recent developments in the
   surrogacy industry to argue against such a ban for two connected
   reasons: the effect of such a ban on the most vulnerable (the
   surrogates); and the utter naivety of trying to resolve a global problem
   merely through restrictive national legislations. In the final section,
   I propose an alternative to the morality frame for understanding
   surrogacy and its corollary - a prohibitive law, and instead focus on
   the notions of reproductive justice and dignity of labour of the
   surrogates via transparency in finances, medical practices and the
   relationships embedded within surrogacy.},

Abstract = {The socioecological framework of public health is a potent approach to
   understanding, addressing, and preventing human trafficking. This
   chapter reviews ways in which six areas important to human trafficking
   can be understood through a public health approach: infectious disease,
   substance use, incarceration, environmental health, technology, and
   media. Applying a public health lens to issues of social determinants of
   health and trauma, including adverse childhood experiences, further
   links human trafficking-related issues to these six areas and related
   sectors.
   Learning Objectives At the end of the chapter, readers will be able to:
   1 Understand the way that the socioecological model can be used to
   conceptualize human trafficking as a public health issue;
   2 Recognize the links between human trafficking and social determinants
   of health, adverse childhood experiences, and trauma-informed care;
   3 Determine the ways that infectious disease, substance use, and the
   criminal justice system intersect with human trafficking and health;
   4 Recognize the ways in which environmental issues impact health and
   human trafficking; and
   5 Understand the role of the media and technology in perpetuating and
   preventing human trafficking.},

Abstract = {Obstetricians and general surgeons frequently navigate the challenges of
   providing surgical care that is mindful of the unique circumstances of
   pregnancy. Ensuring pregnant patients have high-quality surgical care is
   an ethical imperative. Providers should maintain a high index of
   suspicion for surgical disease to ensure that surgical diagnoses are not
   missed or inadequately treated. A variety of imaging modalities are used
   in pregnancy. Surgical management includes laparoscopic and open
   approaches. Perioperative fetal monitoring should be the subject of
   multidisciplinary discussion. Symptomatic control in pregnancy should
   have the same goals as for nonpregnant patients. Enhanced recovery after
   surgery pathways frequently are appropriate.},

Abstract = {Abortion is a hotly debated topic among Muslim communities, yet not many
   people outside of Muslim communities noticed this controversy, assuming
   that all Muslims hold similar opinions. In this paper I seek to answer
   the question: How do anti-abortion and abortion rights groups deploy
   ideas about Islam in their activism regarding abortion? I analysed the
   language those organizations use when describing Muslim communities and
   Muslim views, in order to learn their opinion. I found that a majority
   of those organizations did not include arguments from both sides, and
   almost all the Anti-Abortion Websites included generalizations of the
   Muslim community, and uses the Islamic Religion's conservative factors
   as their method to persuade more Muslim people to join their stance on
   abortion. My research can serve as a contribution to research on broader
   questions such as: Why do a significant amount of people worldwide have
   very monolithic and stereotypical impressions on the Islamic religion?
   How influential is religion to a country's justice system and social
   morals? Those are all relevant question that matters significantly to
   our world, I hope that my research can have an impact and perhaps
   inspire further research into these questions.},

Abstract = {This autoethnographic essay examines the complexity of reproductive
   storytelling. Framed around a pair of interwoven reproductive stories,
   and located within a reproductive justice framework, it asserts that
   women's stories of fertility, pregnancy, contraception, and abortion
   have, both historically and in the contemporary period, been marked by
   silences. Such silences, the result of political, legal, social, and
   moral forces beyond women's control, have limited women's abilities to
   share and reflect on the intricate negotiations that have shaped their
   reproductive lives, and as a consequence, have also limited their
   capacities for telling their reproductive stories. As this article
   argues, all reproductive stories are complex stories. Too often,
   however, those complex nuances that shape women's reproductive lives and
   stories remain hidden, unspoken, and secret. Making room for the
   intricacies of reproductive stories and storytelling can also, this
   article argues, offer greater nuance to continuing debates around
   reproductive rights and reproductive justice.},

Abstract = {Public health programs facilitate access to resources that not only
   provide individuals' options but also often foreclose individual
   preference through prescriptive requirements. This chapter takes two
   disparate cases from public health - vaccines and family planning - that
   reveal patterns of inequality in who has access to individual choice and
   who requires state support to exercise choice. Looking specifically at
   dynamics of funding and compulsion, this chapter elucidates how reliance
   on the rhetoric of individual choice as an expression of freedom rewards
   those with the greatest access to resources and fails to make sure that
   all members of the community have the resources to shape their own
   outcomes or to make sure collective health is protected.},

Title = {Intersectionality as Disarticulatory Practice: Sex-Selective Abortion
   and Reproductive Politics in the United Kingdom},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {37},
Number = {4},
Pages = {509-524},
Abstract = {Many authors have argued that sex-selective abortion (SSA) poses a
   problem for defenders of reproductive choice: the notion that a woman
   has ``freely chosen{''} to abort a female fetus becomes problematic when
   she faces compelling pressure to bear a male child. This argument
   reflects the broader concern of the reproductive justice movement that
   mainstream pro-choice discourse has defined ``choice{''} in narrow,
   legalistic terms, and overlooks the barriers to reproductive choice
   often faced by poor women and women of color. This article examines
   recent debates surrounding a proposed ban on SSA in the United Kingdom.
   It finds that despite attempts by the ban's proponents to make
   intersectional claims around gender, ethnicity, and class, their
   arguments also invoke xenophobia by constructing Indian migrants as a
   threat to ``British{''} values of gender equality. Thus, the article
   suggests that the concept of disarticulation may fruitfully be used to
   make sense of such ``intersectional{''} claims.},

Abstract = {The invisibility of immigrant women's health care and justice needs,
   which are directly related to the triple oppression they face and
   intersectional identities they hold, is highlighted by the silence
   surrounding a requirement that they be immunized against cervical cancer
   with the controversial vaccination, Gardasil. Such a requirement was the
   unintended consequence of a statutory mandate colliding with an agency
   recommendation, and it disproportionately burdened women and girls
   emigrating from Mexico. A quiet and far-reaching coalition used
   unconventional means to get the policy reversed and opened new ways for
   scholars to understand potential responses to agency-level injustices
   for groups marginalized by dominant discourses of public health and
   immigration.},

Abstract = {Professor Ann Scales began her distinguished career by taking feminism
   and reproductive justice seriously. She became a leading feminist voice
   and influence on a number of topics. In later years, she returned to
   concerns about reproductive justice by presciently emphasizing the need
   to preserve women's access to abortions.
   This Essay discusses Professor Scales's concerns and feminist method and
   then turns to reproductive justice. The Essay notes that, with Scales, a
   right to abortion is foundational for reproductive justice. The Essay
   then examines the increasing narrowing of access to abortion through
   law. The Essay next examines a current crisis over access to
   contraception, including arguments that some contraceptives are
   abortifacients and therefore should not be available and the debate over
   insurance coverage for contraception under the Affordable Care Act.
   The Essay concludes with an examination of what reproductive justice
   advocates can do to stop what appears to be a steady undermining of
   rights to abortion and contraception, drawing in part on Professor
   Scales's concern with always examining women's voices and using
   political as well as litigation strategies.},

Abstract = {The author analyzes Ruth Ozeki' s second novel, All Over Creation, and
   the politics of food and gender that it explores. The struggles within
   this novel, Stein maintains, for bio- and social diversity are deeply
   implicated in questions about patriarchal control of women' s
   reproduction and sexuality. All Over Creation follows tensions between
   the captains of transnational corporations who seek the genetic control
   of potatoes and the food activists who resist biogenetic engineering.
   The conflict between these two, Ozeki shows, has important implications
   for reproductive justice, for matters of sexuality, and for diversity
   and free growth. Stein argues that the plot of All Over Creation
   describes compelling intersections between concerns of mainstream
   environmentalists and advocates for women' s reproductive choice.},

Title = {Developing an interactive reproductive health equity session for
   pre-clerkship medical students},
Journal = {MEDICAL EDUCATION ONLINE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {In the United States, sexual, reproductive, and perinatal health
   inequities are well documented and known to be caused by a history of
   systemic oppression along many axes, including but not limited to race,
   ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic position, sexual orientation, and
   disability. Medical schools are responsible for educating students on
   systems of oppression and their impact on health. Reproductive justice
   advocates, including lay persons, medical students, and teaching
   faculty, have urged for integrating the reproductive justice framework
   into medical education and clinical practice. In response to medical
   student advocacy, we developed introductory didactic sessions on social
   and reproductive justice for preclinical medical students. These were
   created in a team-based learning format and include pre-course primer
   materials on reproductive justice. During the sessions, students engaged
   with hypothetical clinical vignettes in small groups to identify
   oppressive structures that may have contributed to the health outcomes
   described and potential avenues for contextually relevant and
   level-appropriate advocacy. The sessions took place in November 2019
   (in-person) and 2020 (virtually) and were well attended by students. We
   highlight our experience, student feedback, and next steps, including
   further integration of reproductive health equity into medical school
   curricula in concert with department-wide education for faculty,
   residents, nursing, and allied health professionals. This introduction
   to social and reproductive justice can be adapted and scaled across
   different medical school curricula, enhancing the training of a new
   generation of physicians to become critically aware of how oppressive
   structures create health inequities and able to mitigate their impact
   through their roles as clinicians, researchers, and advocates.},

Volume = {37},
Number = {6},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Despite a national decline in teenage pregnancy rates, Latinx and Black
   individuals continue to have higher teenage birth rates compared with
   White teens. In the United States, Latinx females (ages 15-19) are more
   than twice as likely to have a teenage birth compared with non-Latinx
   White teens. With an increasingly diverse nation, a shift toward
   culturally inclusive approaches to care is critical to achieving
   equitable patient outcomes. Improving access to preventive care,
   workforce diversity, and insurance coverage will lead to cost-savings
   and help restore trust in a system that has failed past generations. In
   this commentary, targeted recommendations tailored specifically toward
   Latinx women will be provided, including culturally competent birth
   control counseling and a focus on reproductive justice. Not speaking
   English, low socioeconomic status, acculturation, legal status, and
   being uninsured are all teenage pregnancy risk factors unique to Latinx
   women. Cultural preferences and attitudes toward contraception must also
   be considered. Further expansion of Medicaid insurance coverage is also
   necessary to increase reproductive access among vulnerable populations.
   A cultural humility framework to reproductive health counseling and
   services is recommended. Within this framework, family engagement is
   encouraged, and women are free from reproductive coercion; they have the
   freedom to access over-the-counter contraception and receive guidance
   and support from providers and community health workers who are
   cognizant of culture and heritage. An integrated community-based
   approach that is culturally sensitive and in tune with Latinx
   heterogenicity is necessary to lower teenage pregnancy rates and achieve
   reproductive justice.},

Title = {Reimagining the Future of Reproduction from a Black Queer Lens: An
   Art-Based Approach to the Study of Reproductive Health Care},
Journal = {HEALTH COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 1},
Abstract = {Black Queer people's reproductive experiences are largely
   under-documented and under-reported in health communication research,
   despite the omnipresence of their storytelling within humanities-based
   literature. Drawing from a larger health study using Black feminist
   perspectives and centering Black Queer people's lived experiences with
   reproduction, previous health research, and Black Queer poetics, this
   study uses an art-based research approach to create erasure poems that
   detail how Black Queer birthing people resist and survive
   reproductive-based injustices. Specifically, through this innovative
   approach, I construct eight erasure poems developed from the previous
   insights of Black Queer people's answer to ``What is the future of
   reproduction?{''} These poems detail unparalleled truths about the needs
   and strategies that necessitate efforts to improve reproductive justice
   for my community. The poems detail Black Queer people's discussions of
   the importance of community networks along our reproductive health
   journeys, creating new conceptualizations of motherhood and parenthood,
   new understandings of reproductive-based stigma and oppression, and our
   use of spirituality as a tool for reclaiming reproductive autonomy.},

   Screening Tool},
Journal = {HEALTH PROMOTION PRACTICE},

Month = {2024 OCT 25},
Abstract = {We aim to develop and formatively evaluate a brief social needs
   screening tool that adheres to Massachusetts Department of Public Health
   (MDPH) clinical service standards for sexual and reproductive health
   (SRH) agencies and is acceptable and feasible for use by staff during a
   clinical encounter. Through a multi-stage literature and expert review
   process, we developed an evidence-informed, two-page social needs
   screening tool, scoring form, and implementation guide. We piloted this
   tool at three SRH agencies in Massachusetts and recruited staff to
   provide quantitative and qualitative feedback through post-pilot test
   self-reported surveys and semi-structured interviews. Participants (n =
   13) felt the social needs screening tool was easy to integrate into
   their clinical workflow and were comfortable using it with patients. All
   participants reported feeling comfortable administering the tool,
   scoring it, and referring patients to appropriate resources, if
   applicable. Most reported they would like to continue using the tool
   after the pilot implementation period, either with or without
   modifications. Our multi-stage tool development and formative evaluation
   process involving literature review, expert review, and pilot-testing in
   clinical settings enabled our team to create a brief, evidence-informed
   social needs screening tool that is acceptable to staff and feasible for
   use during a short clinic visit at SRH agencies in Massachusetts. Staff
   felt that there is value in using this tool, are comfortable using it,
   and are able to integrate it into their existing clinical workflows.},

Title = {The Experience of Birth Professionals Who Witness Obstetric Violence
   During Childbirth},
Journal = {AFFILIA-FEMINIST INQUIRY IN SOCIAL WORK},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 23},
Abstract = {Research The experience of obstetric violence is well documented.
   However, the impact on and experience of doulas and midwives who witness
   OV deserves more attention. The research questions that guided this
   study were: What types of harm are doulas and midwives witnessing, what
   factors influence their decision to intervene, and what impact does this
   experience have on their professional career and well-being?Methods This
   exploratory study used semi-structured qualitative interviews to
   understand how doulas and midwives navigate the experience of witnessing
   OV. The data analysis included reflexive thematic analysis. Feminist
   standpoint theory was employed to center the lived experiences of women
   and other individuals from marginalized groups in the research and in
   the knowledge acquisition process.Key contributions This study found
   that independent birth professionals like doulas and midwives are
   struggling with how to navigate their roles in the obstetric system.
   They find creative ways to advocate yet are often met with mistreatment
   themselves. This work is a call to action to the field of social work to
   engage in issues related to perinatal health and reproductive justice.},

Abstract = {The World War II mass incarceration of 120,000 Japanese Americans
   disrupted families, enacted intergenerational trauma, and characterized
   Japanese Americans as inherent racial threats. This federal exercise in
   biopolitical management intersected with state-sponsored eugenic
   sterilization in California institutions. Linking War Relocation
   Authority and California Department of Institutions records, we document
   32 Japanese American sterilization survivors during the wartime
   incarceration period (1942-1946). We show how federal and state
   authority converged to deprive Japanese Americans of civil rights and
   reproductive liberty. We add original research and analysis to the
   intertwined histories of Japanese American incarceration, eugenics, and
   family in the United States.},

Title = {Reflecting sex, social class and race inequalities in reproduction?
   Study of the gender representations conveyed by 38 fertility centre
   websites in 8 European countries},
Journal = {REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH},

Abstract = {BackgroundFertility centre websites are a key sources of information on
   medically assisted reproduction (MAR) for both infertile people and the
   general public. As part of a global fertility market, they are also a
   window to attract potential future patients. They give formal and
   practical information but in the way the information is displayed, they
   also convey social representations, and in particular, gender
   representation in its intersectional dimension. The objective is to
   analyse the sex, class and race representations regarding reproduction
   and parenthood that are embedded in the content of fertility centre
   websites in eight European countries.MethodsThe 5 most visible fertility
   centres that appeared in the first places on Internet search were
   selected for each country under study, except for one country which has
   only three fertility centres. In total, 38 fertility centre websites
   were considered for a thematic analysis using an iterative approach and
   a comprehensive perspective.ResultsEach centre details its services and
   techniques according to the legal provisions in force in its country.
   However, on all the websites studied, the fertility centres demonstrate
   a strong gendered representation. The logos generally depict women or
   parts of their bodies, as do the photos, which mainly show white women
   with light eyes. The description of the causes of infertility and the
   techniques offered by the centres also highlights gender differences.
   Sperm donation, where MAR is reserved for heterosexual couples, is
   included among the techniques for women with the comment that it will
   enable them to fulfil their dream of becoming mothers.ConclusionsMAR,
   and through it the project of having a child and procreative work, is
   presented as a matter for white, cisgender and heterosexual women, thus
   fueling stratified reproduction and limiting reproductive justice. The
   research team formulated guidelines for fertility centres to encourage
   them to adopt a more inclusive approach in terms of sex, social class
   and race, so that the diversity of infertile people feel involved and
   welcome in these centres, to avoid misperceptions about infertility in
   the general population and to reinforce autonomy and justice in
   reproductive matters.
   Fertility centre websites are a key sources of information on medically
   assisted reproduction (MAR) for both people undergoing MAR and the
   general public. As part of a global fertility market, they may also be a
   window to attract potential future patients. In this context, they
   convey formal and practical information but also, through their content,
   narratives and visuals, social representations. The objective is here to
   analyse the gender representations of reproduction and parenthood that
   the 38 European fertility centres under study convey through the texts
   and images they display on their websites. Each centre details its
   services and techniques according to the social and legal provisions in
   force in its country. However, on all the websites studied, the
   fertility centres demonstrate a strong gendered representation,
   including in terms of social class and race. MAR, and through it the
   project of having a child and procreative work, is presented as a matter
   for white, cisgender and heterosexual women, thus fueling stratified
   reproduction and limiting reproductive justice.},

Title = {One Hundred Years of Seeking Respectful Maternity Care: History and
   Evolution},
Journal = {BIRTH-ISSUES IN PERINATAL CARE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 16},
Abstract = {Growing awareness of poor maternal health outcomes and maternal health
   disparities in the United States has heightened urgency around the need
   to promote Respectful Maternity Care (RMC) as a fundamental tenet of
   obstetric/midwifery care and standardize efforts to improve safety,
   eliminate obstetric violence and racism, and optimize health outcomes
   for all birthing people. The historical context of prior and
   contemporary perspectives around childbirth influences our understanding
   of RMC and are shaped by varying scholarly, clinical, and community
   standards (e.g., religion, human rights, government, public health,
   midwifery, ethics, activism, and the law), which have changed
   significantly since the mid-19th century. In this commentary, we share
   results of a contextual question scoped as part of a larger systematic
   review of RMC to help inform consensus around a shared definition and
   development of a metric to standardize delivery and evaluation of RMC.
   Synthesis of this literature identified landmark historical influences
   on RMC over the past 100 years, highlighting the multidisciplinary
   scholarship and historical context influencing the progress toward RMC.
   Further understanding of this history may also inform policies and
   guidance for ongoing efforts to center respect and accountability in all
   aspects of maternity care, with particular attention to populations who
   are disproportionally impacted by disrespectful care.
   Understanding the historical context of prior and contemporary
   perspectives around childbirth influences our understanding of
   respectful maternity care, shaping both the proposed AHRQ Respectful
   MaternityCare framework and related definition that aim to facilitate
   consensus around a common definition and help standardize policies and
   guidance to center respect and accountability in all aspects of
   maternity care.image},

Title = {``Sport Belongs to Everyone… But Not During Pregnancy{''}: Views of
   Finnish Sport Stakeholders on Pregnancy in Sport},
Journal = {SEX ROLES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 10},
Abstract = {The social construction of pregnancy emphasizes the mother's
   responsibility for the developing fetus. Hence, certain activities, such
   as participation in competitive sport, are often constructed as
   inappropriate during pregnancy. While expert opinion tends to stress
   caution, the diversity of athlete mothers' experiences challenge these
   dominant discourses. Less is known about how peers and other
   stakeholders in sport view the participation of pregnant athletes.
   Knowledge of such attitudes is essential to understanding the position
   of women in a specific society and the barriers to their autonomy.
   Hence, we examined survey responses from different sport stakeholders (N
   = 540) in Finland. Drawing on relational dialectics theory (Baxter, L.
   A. (2011). Voicing relationships. Sage.), we used contrapuntal analysis
   to identify different discourses on the compatibility of pregnancy and
   sport, and their interplay. Three discourses were identified: an
   equality discourse, which emphasizes that sport belongs to everyone, and
   that pregnant people should be accepted and supported in sporting
   environments; a responsibility discourse, which constructs pregnancy as
   fragility and sport as potentially dangerous for the athlete and the
   fetus; and an incompatibility discourse, which constructs pregnancy as a
   disease and unacceptable in sporting environments. Our analysis shows
   that medicalized, authoritative knowledge is the master strategy used to
   keep women out of male social spaces during pregnancy. The findings of
   our study highlight the ongoing struggle for reproductive justice in a
   patriarchal world order. To advance women's position in society and
   support the autonomy of all individuals, viable professional guidelines
   and organizational policies must be formulated and applied.},

Title = {Toward abortion decriminalization: Irish abortion activism and the power
   of legal ambivalence},
Journal = {IRISH POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 4},
Abstract = {This article explores the role of feminist legal ambivalence in Irish
   abortion activism, arguing for its continued relevance after the repeal
   of the Eighth Amendment. Legal ambivalence, which involves a combination
   of skepticism and engagement with the law, has long been a feature of
   feminist theory due to the law's role in maintaining patriarchal norms.
   In the context of Irish abortion advocacy, this ambivalence has provided
   strategic advantages. Early resistance from the Irish Church and State
   led activists to approach legal reforms with caution, fostering a
   productive ambivalence that facilitated actions such as accessing
   abortions abroad and employing art-based protests. The article outlines
   how this nuanced stance toward the law evolved over time, benefiting
   feminist and reproductive rights activism. It argues that Irish abortion
   advocates should capitalize on this history by advocating for the full
   decriminalization of abortion. This strategy, the article suggests,
   carries symbolic power, has been proven advantageous in other countries,
   and is both pragmatic and feasible in Ireland. Ultimately, the article
   calls for a continued embrace of legal ambivalence as a tool to
   challenge restrictive laws and advance reproductive freedom.},

Title = {A Quality Improvement Approach to Increasing Access to long-Acting
   Reversible Contraceptives in a Federally Qualified Health Center},
Journal = {MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH JOURNAL},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 3},
Abstract = {ObjectivesLong-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) are the most
   effective forms of contraception available and therefore play a critical
   role in supporting patients to exercise bodily autonomy and achieve
   reproductive goals. A comprehensive set of quality improvement (QI)
   interventions were implemented between March and June 2019 to improve
   LARC access at a federally qualified health center (FQHC) in (US
   State).MethodsAn evaluation study was conducted to assess the impact of
   the QI initiative considering the number of LARCS delivered as a proxy
   for access. The Wilcoxon-rank test was applied to test for significance,
   given a non-parametric sample of LARCs delivered by 13 providers
   (matched to themselves) pre- and post-intervention. Reimbursement for
   LARC procedures pre- and post-intervention was also examined to
   determine economic impact and sustainability of incorporating a new
   device, the Liletta (TM), in the floor stock.ResultsThere was a
   statistically significant increase in LARC delivery between July
   2019-March 2020 compared to July 2018-March 2019. Approximately \$1,000
   per month increased reimbursement for LARC services occurred
   post-intervention. The evaluation study concluded success of the QI
   intervention, with need for further study needed to determine equitable
   delivery of contraceptive services between different subpopulations and
   by insurance status.Conclusions for PracticeThe study provides a
   blueprint for QI initiatives to improve access to LARCs while also
   increasing revenue for LARC services in an FQHC setting.
   What is already known on this subject?LARC services at FQHCs has been
   described at the national level. (Beeson et al., Contraception
   (Stoneham), 89(2), 91-96.
   https://doi.org/10.1016/j.contraception.2013.09.014, 2014) Prospective
   cohort trials have been conducted to assess the impact of optimizing
   LARC access via the CHOICE project studies. McNicholas (Clin. Obstet.
   Gynecol. 57(4):635-643, 2014) A study of Title X funded clinics examined
   the impact of stocking the Liletta (TM) device (Roth et al.,
   Contraception (Stoneham), 98(1), 63-68.
   https://doi.org/10.1016/j.contraception.2018.03.029, 2018), and DeBoer
   (NWH 22(4):302-309, 2018) report on a QI approach to align LARC delivery
   with recent guidelines.What this study adds?The paper defines
   operational considerations for improving LARC access, including device
   stocking and management, staff capacity, and appointment/schedule
   management, using a multidisciplinary QI approach, with positive
   financial impact.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY \& OBSTETRICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 3},
Abstract = {A fundamental component of the basic right to health is the right to
   sexual health, encompassing an individual's right to decide freely on
   matters of sexual and reproductive health without discrimination.
   Provision of these rights is inextricably linked with a wide range of
   other internationally agreed upon human rights, including the right to
   information, participation, and equality. Evidence has shown that
   provision of these rights not only improves maternal and neonatal
   health, but also healthcare worker safety and the provision of a vast
   array of critical and necessary medical care. And yet, too often-and
   with increasing frequency-sexual and reproductive rights are being
   violated worldwide, with rising taboos, stigma, and discrimination,
   particularly within abortion, contraception, and fertility care. FIGO
   strongly supports comprehensive, equitable, and accessible sexual and
   reproductive health care for all individuals, recognizing that these
   rights are essential components of global health and fundamental human
   rights. This includes a particular emphasis on special populations,
   healthcare workers, and women and girls in crisis zones. FIGO encourages
   its member societies to deliver comprehensive sexual and reproductive
   health care, advocate for coverage for sexual and reproductive health
   care, become involved in analyzing barriers to access within health
   systems, and provide nonjudgemental, confidential, person-centered care.},

Abstract = {Since the era of chattel slavery, the state has used institutionalized
   abuse and violence as a tool for reproductive control. Today, public
   institutions and social services have been established by the state to
   police and surveil the behavior of poor communities and parents to
   maintain the reproductive violence and oppression that began centuries
   ago. This paper uses a reproductive justice framework to explore how the
   history of criminalizing pregnancy, surveilling Black and Indigenous
   communities, and denying reproductive autonomy are connected to and
   maintained by the present-day family policing system. In doing so, this
   paper expands on existing literature to create a stronger link and build
   solidarity between the movements against family policing and
   reproductive oppression.},

Abstract = {Abortion is among the most widely disagreed upon topics in bioethics and
   healthcare. Consider how abortion is taught to medical students: while
   some medical schools incorporate abortion into their standard
   curriculum, others omit it entirely. In this article, the author argues
   these discrepancies go against society's interest in producing
   physicians with comprehensive medical knowledge-especially for common
   procedures like abortions. The author thus argues all US medical schools
   have a moral obligation to provide abortion education and clinical
   training opportunities to their students. For the sake of argumentation,
   the author attempts to justify this claim remaining morally neutral on
   abortion.},

   within a predominantly Black rural community in the United States. I
   draw on a case study of Gadsden County, Florida-a community that is
   perceived by its members to be a maternity care desert but that is not
   technically defined as one-to demonstrate how Black birthing people are
   cultivating a reproductive liberatory consciousness. Semi-structured
   interviews with birthing persons and reproductive health experts reveal
   three overarching processes-naming barriers to health equity, resisting
   health inequity and cultivating health equity-that characterise a
   reproductive liberatory consciousness, which I identify as an analytical
   tool to outline how local social actors are identifying structural
   constraints as well as developing strategies of communal care and
   resistance. This work contributes to sociological research on
   reproductive justice and health equity by exploring the limitations of
   `desert' frameworks. Pointing to the need to carefully consider the
   mechanisms that actively disrupt and potentially transform spatial
   stratifications and inequities, this paper advances a new understanding
   of birthing space that captures the layered movements of those living
   within a perceived maternity care desert.},

Title = {Building Collective Power to Advance Maternal and Child Health Equity:
   Lessons from the New Orleans Maternal and Child Health Coalition},
Journal = {MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH JOURNAL},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 28},
Abstract = {ObjectivesThe New Orleans Maternal Child Health Coalition convenes to
   support and amplify the work of New Orleans-based individuals and
   organizations working to reduce disparities and protect the health of
   birthing families in the New Orleans area. The objectives of this
   qualitative study were to identify successes, challenges, and areas of
   growth for the Coalition and develop broadly generalizable
   recommendations for similar groups seeking to mobilize and advance
   health equity in their own communities.MethodsUsing purposive sampling,
   we conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 key informants from
   within and outside of the Coalition. Interviews were transcribed
   verbatim, and data was analyzed using inductive and deductive coding
   approaches.ResultsWe identified themes relating to the barriers and
   facilitators to the maintenance of the Coalition, as well as
   opportunities to advance the mission of the Coalition. Some themes
   included structural- and systemic-level barriers to achieving the
   mission, varying perspectives on the effectiveness of the Coalition,
   opportunities to enhance the operations of the Coalition's work, and
   opportunities to involve other individuals, particularly those with
   lived experience, and non-MCH related sectors in Coalition's
   work.Conclusions for PracticeAs the maternal health crisis continues,
   coalitions like the New Orleans MCH Coalition provide a vehicle to
   amplify the mission-driven work of people and organizations.
   Recommendations put forth by the Coalition can also be utilized by
   coalitions in other jurisdictions.
   What is Already Known on this Subject?Black-White disparities in
   maternal and child health (MCH) have a longstanding history within the
   United States (US) and these disparities are mirrored in New Orleans,
   LA. The New Orleans Maternal and Child Health Coalition was founded to
   support the collective efficacy of numerous individuals and
   organizations to protect the health of birthing families in the
   community.What Does this Study Add?We identified the key barriers and
   facilitators to achieving the Coalition's mission and building
   collective power to achieve MCH equity in the greater New Orleans area.
   Such evidence is a crucial contribution during this time when rates of
   maternal mortality and morbidity continue to rise throughout the
   country. This study amplifies the importance of community-driven work to
   address disparities in MCH and enhance health equity.},

Abstract = {Young people account for over half of new STI cases and youth of color
   face increased sexual health disparities. In partnership with Fact
   Forward, researchers conducted qualitative formative audience research
   to develop a culture-centered health communication campaign to increase
   access to and use of sexual health services among youth of color in
   South Carolina. Grounded in a reproductive justice theoretical
   framework, this study employed innovative strategies, including training
   youth ambassadors to moderate peer-to-peer focus groups. A total of 134
   participants were recruited for the study with 51 individuals
   participating in 9 focus groups and 83 respondents completing a
   web-based survey (ages 15-24). Qualitative data analyses used Nvivo
   1.5.1. Statistical analyses used R Studio (R). Findings revealed
   barriers including lack of education about risks. Participants
   identified dimensions of inequity and the importance of intersectional
   messaging to address intimacy, sexuality, and trust. They emphasized
   normalizing conversations about sexual health and the need for important
   others ``in your corner{''} to provide support. Participants suggested
   an empowering storytelling approach to reduce shame surrounding sexual
   health services. Social media emerged as an optimal communication
   channel. UNC Perceived Message Effectiveness (PME) Scale scores ranged
   from 4.42 to 4.57 (out of 5) indicating that messages were well received
   by participants. Sex-positive campaign messaging focused on self-love,
   empowerment, and taking control of sexual health. This study offers
   practical suggestions to develop effective communication strategies to
   reach youth of color to increase use of sexual health services,
   including contraceptive counseling, STI prevention, screening, and
   treatment.},

Abstract = {In their recent book, Arendt, Natality and Biopolitics, Rosalyn Diprose
   and Ewa Plonowska Ziarek reconstruct Hannah Arendt's concept of natality
   in order to diagnose and resist biopolitical threats to democratic
   plurality. Their analysis leads them to engage indigenous reproductive
   justice organizing; that engagement is the focus of my critique. I argue
   that their understanding of the biopolitical targeting of indigenous
   people needs further development. Diprose and Ziarek tend to read
   indigenous organizers as working toward inclusion in the democratic
   plurality of settler societies. While that is the aim of some indigenous
   organizations and actors, that is not the aim of many, including a
   theorist and activist they engage, Katsi Cook (Mohawk). I suggest that
   their engagement with indigenous reproductive justice organizing is
   shaped by the important, but unthematized role settler colonialism has
   in Arendt's work. I further argue that Cook provides crucial theoretical
   and practical challenges to the settler state and its role in feminist
   theoretical projects of critique.},

Title = {Vulnerable Youth or Vulnerabilising Contexts? A Critical Review of Youth
   Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) Policies in Eastern and
   Southern Africa},
Journal = {SEXUALITY RESEARCH AND SOCIAL POLICY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 11},
Abstract = {IntroductionPolicy decisions about young people's sexual and
   reproductive health and rights (SRHR) have far-reaching implications for
   their well-being. Few SRHR policies, however, focus specifically on
   youth. Rather, youth SRHR tends to be subsumed within national policies
   of Health, Youth, Education and Development Ministries, particularly in
   the Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA) region, complicating an assessment
   of the overall state of youth SRHR policies. Given the fact that youth
   SRHR policies focus on a particular segment of the population-youth,
   teenagers or adolescents-how policies depict these subjects has
   implications for how policy objectives, programmes and interventions are
   conceptualised and the kind of sexual and reproductive health concerns
   that are prioritised.MethodsUsing a subject positioning lens, our
   critical review of youth SRHR policy in force between 2010 and 2020
   spans policy domains to examine depictions of young people across 88 ESA
   policy documents. Our analysis aimed to identify the qualities and
   responsibilities associated with different youth subject positions and
   the broader implications thereof for young people's SRHR.ResultsWe
   identify two dominant youth subject positions-risky youth and
   youth-at-risk-both of which construct risk as inherent to young people,
   overwhelmingly emphasise negative repercussions of youth sexual
   practices, foreground individualised interventions and hold young people
   responsible for preventing negative sexual and reproductive health (SRH)
   outcomes in the absence of policy objectives that meaningfully address
   structural constraints on their agency.ConclusionsConsidering the
   dominance of public health research underpinning youth SRHR, our
   findings contribute a much-needed critical social theory complement that
   supports holistic, justice-oriented and contextually embedded policy
   responses to young people's SRHR.Policy ImplicationsBased on our
   findings, we provide policy recommendations that support a conceptual
   shift away from vulnerable youth to vulnerabilising contexts, such that
   young people's vulnerability to adverse SRH outcomes is situated in the
   enabling and constraining conditions in which they live their lives.},

   The Dobbs v Jackson decision has the potential to limit choice while

Title = {Reflections on being a Thai transman through the lens of the
   reproductive justice framework},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF LESBIAN STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 27},
Abstract = {Transmen are a crucial gender group within the umbrella of transgender
   identities, yet there remains a lack of understanding regarding their
   gender identities and sexualities. Transmen often face challenges
   related to gender discrimination and inequalities, particularly in
   accessing government services such as healthcare and social welfare, and
   in securing legal recognition of their gender identity and rights. This
   article explores the challenges faced by transmen in Thailand. It
   through a discussion of the lived experiences and gender identities of
   Thai transmen by examining the societal context through existing
   literature and qualitative interviews of transmen on their own. The aim
   is to examine the specific local context of Thai transmen using a
   reproductive justice approach to examine how transmen experience gender
   discrimination when challenging the dominant cis-normative gender norms
   in Thai society. Understanding these challenges can contribute to
   creating fundamental knowledge for a better understanding of transmen's
   identities and inform recommendations for public policies that support
   greater gender diversity and a more inclusive environment. Importantly,
   supporting legal gender recognition based on self-identified gender can
   promote reproductive justice for transgender people.},

Title = {Crafting the unsayable: Making meaning out of racialised maternal
   health-care encounters},
Journal = {SOCIOLOGY OF HEALTH \& ILLNESS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 27},
Abstract = {There are persistent and profound racialised inequalities in maternal
   and reproductive health in the UK. Yet in multiple settings, these
   disparities have been blamed on class or ethnicity, individuals and
   communities rather than the structures within which they live. In this
   study, we draw on narratives told within a `slow-stitch' craft workshop,
   organised in southern England for racialised women with reproductive
   trauma, to show how processes of racialisation and racism shape
   experiences of maternal and reproductive healthcare. Experiences of
   reproductive trauma were multiple and cumulative. The burden of
   knowledge of racialised disparities was carried into health-care spaces,
   with plans made in advance to self-manage in risky spaces. The constant
   management of racialised stereotypes and subsequent strategies of bodily
   and emotional containment ultimately was not protective and there was
   little agency over levels of care received in health-care spaces.
   Perceptions surrounding racialised bodies shaped treatment, whilst
   proximities to whiteness afforded alternative realities. Taking a
   phenomenological approach we analyse race as a sensory, spatial and
   relational constellation haunted by long-standing histories of fraught
   inequality. Bringing together in the crafting circle a group of women
   racialised in different ways enabled the sharing of ``unspeakable{''}
   stories surrounding racism and reproductive trauma, and allowed race to
   be brought into being as a form of solidarity and connection.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF LESBIAN STUDIES},

Abstract = {The intersection between the feminist movement and the LGBTQIA +
   movement regarding assisted reproductive techniques has fostered greater
   openness towards the reproductive possibilities of lesbian and bisexual
   motherhood in Spain. Until February 2023, lesbian couples were obliged
   to marry in order to jointly register their children. Access to assisted
   reproductive technologies in Spain requires medicalised processes and
   the mandatory anonymity of sperm donors. In this context, we explore how
   lesbian mothers narrate their journeys towards parenthood through an
   analysis of interviews. As reproductive rights are individualised
   through the use of medical interventions, we apply the notion of
   reproductive justice as a lens to question how women's bodies are
   medicalised through a cultural and socio-legal system that imposes
   mandatory anonymous sperm donation over other possible forms of kinship
   construction.},

Abstract = {On June 24, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court issued the Dobbs v. Jackson
   Women's Health Organization decision, overturning 50 years of protected
   abortion rights in the United States. The decision directly impacts the
   way social work educators address current social issues that relate to
   bodily autonomy and social justice. This paper used mixed methodology to
   collect quantitative and qualitative survey data from MSW students to
   explore how they perceive the overturning of Roe v. Wade, how the topic
   was covered in their social work courses, and receive recommendations on
   how it should be taught. Constructivist Grounded Theory and Thematic
   Analysis were used to code for reoccurring and emergent themes. Findings
   indicate that students believe the Dobbs decision was not discussed
   enough in social work courses, that students believe reproductive
   justice discussions should be grounded in NASW values, and that students
   view the Dobbs decision negatively. Student suggestions for teaching
   reproductive justice are to focus on educational information, try to
   avoid politics, and set a civil classroom tone. The aim of this research
   study is to elevate the voices of students as educators grapple with
   navigating how the Dobbs decision impacts micro- and macro-level
   curriculum.},

Volume = {37},

Abstract = {Place and the intergenerational transmission of cultural knowledge are
   deeply intertwined among Indigenous groups due to the significance of
   the environment and land within Indigenous ideologies, and the legacies
   of displacement wrought by settler colonialism. Little research explores
   this topic among Indigenous tribes in the Gulf South, who face unique
   environmental challenges related to climate change, land loss, oil
   extraction, and who depend on the coastal environment for cultural and
   subsistence resources. Scholarship on this topic among tribes that are
   not federally recognized is similarly limited. Using semi-structured
   interviews among 31 self-identified women members of a U.S. Gulf South
   tribe, we show how gendered and place-based knowledges manifest within
   the embodied and material experiences of tribal members, as well as the
   ways that those experiences and the transmission of knowledge are
   mediated by political and environmental changes through the example of
   traditional health and healing practices and knowledges. Key findings
   that emerged include: (a) Place-Based Concerns about Environmental
   Change and Displacement; (b) Concerns about Future Generational Changes
   in Knowledge Transmission; (c) Loss of Indigenous Health Knowledge. We
   suggest that there are significant impediments to the sociocultural
   reproduction of traditional health and healing practices and knowledges
   within the tribe brought about by environmental changes (e.g. saltwater
   intrusion, land loss, etc.) and the continuing influx of Western
   medicinal knowledge and practices. In contextualizing these findings
   within the environmental reproductive justice framework, we echo extant
   intersectional environmental research suggesting that environmental
   degradation and legacies of settler colonialism, by virtue of
   place-based and gendered knowledges and labor, disproportionately burden
   women, especially Indigenous women. We also note that despite
   significant material and cultural threats, tribal members demonstrate
   resilience and resistance to the macro-scale forces obstructing
   Indigenous ways of life.},

Abstract = {The 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health
   Organization overturned reproductive, health, and abortion rights for
   women. Using the NASW Code of Ethics, a course assignment is offered for
   students to examine the professional, ethical commitment and
   responsibility of social workers to advocate for these rights and
   reproductive justice for women. Practical ideas for incorporating
   content examining ethics into coursework in higher education are
   examined. An advocacy practice and policy model is provided and examined
   for consideration and use for advocacy when promoting reproductive
   rights and justice for women. The course assignment centers on the work
   of Freire (1970), as students work in small groups to identify
   generative themes in relationship to the NASW Code of Ethics and
   reproductive and health rights and justice for women. Practical and
   useful follow-up considerations, assignments, and takeaways are offered
   for assessing student learning in relationship to the course assignment.},

Title = {Freedom for some, but not for Mum: the reproductive injustice associated
   with pandemic `Freedom Day' for perinatal women in the United Kingdom},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Month = {AUG 7},
Abstract = {Introduction Healthcare services for pregnant and postpartum
   ('perinatal') women were reconfigured significantly at the advent and
   for the duration of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and despite the United
   Kingdom announcing `Freedom Day' on 19 July 2021 (whereafter all legal
   lockdown-related restrictions were lifted), restrictions to maternity
   (antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal) services remained. This study
   presents data from eight perinatal women about their experiences of
   psychosocial wellbeing and maternity care in the post-'Freedom Day'
   epoch.Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted virtually, with
   data recorded, transcribed, and analysed by hand. Grounded theory
   analysis was employed with the final theory assessing the reproductive
   injustice of the pandemic `Freedom Day'.Results Analysing iteratively
   and inductively led to four emergent themes: `A Failing System, Failing
   Women'; `Harm Caused by a State of Difference'; `The Privileges (Not
   Rights) of Reproductive Autonomy, Agency, and Advocacy'; and `Worried
   Women and Marginalised Mothers'. Together, these themes form the theory
   of `Freedom for some, but not for Mum'.Discussion Women experienced a
   lack of high-quality reliable information about the pandemic,
   vaccination against the virus, and the changes to, and decision-making
   surrounding, their perinatal care. Women recognised healthcare
   professionals and maternity services were stretched and that maternity
   services were failing but often reported hostility from staff and
   abandonment at times when they were unsure about how to navigate their
   care. The most singular injustice was the disparity between women having
   to accept continuing restrictions to their freedom whilst receiving
   maternity care and the (reckless) freedom being enacted by the general
   public.},

Title = {Bridging Silos: Environmental and Reproductive Justice in the Climate
   Crisis},

Abstract = {The climate crisis is a perilous yet underexamined example of the
   intersection of environmental injustice and reproductive injustice. The
   physical manifestations of the climate crisis affect key elements of
   reproductive justice: women's rights to have children, to not have
   children, and to parent children in healthy, sustainable communities.
   Reams of studies document climate disaster-driven gender violence, loss
   of access to healthcare and reproductive services, as well as direct and
   deadly health effects of climate change on maternal health, fetal
   development, infants, and children. Despite these profound impacts, the
   environmental and reproductive justice movements remain largely siloed,
   particularly in the legal community. This Article makes two
   interventions into existing legal scholarship. First, the Article
   identifies an intersectional nexus of hazard between environmental and
   reproductive justice, which is especially acute for women of color
   living in under-resourced communities. It argues that environmental
   injustices in the context of the climate crisis undermine reproductive
   justice. Second, the Article explores how the movements can align
   strands of their advocacy and suggests how advocates can leverage
   various legal and policy strategies to mitigate these intersectional
   injustices. It argues for a ground-up approach based on community
   power-building and interdisciplinary cooperation, which can inform legal
   and policy solutions at scale. Collective action to foster health and
   dignity has never been more urgent, as climate change harms escalate,
   maternal health deteriorates, and the Supreme Court issues decisions
   shredding reproductive autonomy and circumscribing environmental
   regulatory authority.},

Abstract = {Following the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision,
   Republican-controlled legislatures across the U.S. initiated draconian
   abortion restrictions. In order to appeal to anti-abortion policymakers,
   advocates across the country have strategically separated ``maternal and
   child health{''} (MCH) issues, such as increased insurance coverage for
   midwifery and doula care, from issues often labeled as ``reproductive
   rights,{''} such as access to sex education, birth control, and
   abortion. Advocates point out this strategic separation has likely
   contributed overall to the downfall of abortion rights. In this paper,
   we analyze legislative discourse to understand the legislative
   challenges advocates face, the strategic separations and allyships they
   employ, and the implications for other states and reproductive health
   more broadly. We find that legislators legitimate the same scientific
   evidence in some contexts while not in others in order to hold onto
   rhetorical purity within the abortion debate. In their attempts to parse
   the ideal abortion seeker, conservative legislators create legal
   ambiguities with serious consequences for healthcare.},

Abstract = {Jasmine is an 18-year-old Black female bringing her infant to the
   pediatrician for a newborn weight check. She asks her pediatrician's
   opinion about hormonal contraceptive injections, sharing that they were
   strongly recommended after she gave birth. The recommending health care
   provider told her, ``We don't want you to end up back here any time
   soon.{''} Rosita, a 16-year-old Latina female, visits her pediatrician
   for a well check. She reports a history of vaginal sex with 2 male
   partners and agrees to have a hormonal subcutaneous implant placed to
   avoid pregnancy. After 4 months of bothersome spotting, Rosita returns
   to have the implant removed. Rosita's provider strongly counsels against
   removal. Jasmine and Rosita are members of populations that have been
   systematically marginalized throughout American history. Their stories
   are derived from real cases and reveal how structural racism impacts
   modern contraceptive care. Specifically, their cases are examples of
   statistical discrimination, wherein the tendency to disproportionately
   recommend long-acting reversible contraception to historically
   marginalized communities does not follow the central tenants of sexual
   and reproductive justice, including acknowledging historical harms in
   health care and honoring bodily autonomy for all people. By sharing
   Jasmine and Rosita's stories, we use a reproductive justice lens to (1)
   examine the historical roots of disproportional prescription of
   long-acting reversible contraception to historically marginalized
   individuals, (2) discuss provider bias related to sexual and
   reproductive health care, and (3) illustrate how trauma-informed care
   with a recognition of historical trauma and the use of individuation can
   facilitate positive and equitable health outcomes.},

Title = {Researchers' perspectives of self-agency within a context of violence
   and harm in maternity care},
Journal = {MIDWIFERY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {137},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Problem: There is an increasing awareness of the prevalence of obstetric
   violence within maternity care and that some women and birthing people
   are at greater risk of experiencing violence and harm. Background:
   Supporting self-agency for women and birthing people in maternity care
   may be a way of addressing the disparities in vulnerability to violence
   and harm. Aim: To explore researchers' perspectives of self-agency for
   women from different backgrounds, what inhibits and prevents
   self-agency, and how self-agency can be enabled. Methods: A qualitative
   research design was undertaken underpinned by a reproductive justice
   framework. Group interviews were held with researchers working with
   perinatal women/birthing people with histories and experiences of
   violence and abuse. Reflexive thematic analysis using Bronfenbrenner's
   ecological systems theory was undertaken. Findings: 12 participants took
   part in two group interviews. Two themes were developed: ` defining
   self-agency' and ` ecological influences on self-agency'. . Discussion:
   The findings identify how self-agency should not be perceived as an
   intrinsic attribute, but rather is underpinned by exogenous and
   endogenous influences. Whether and how self-agency is enacted is
   determined by interacting factors that operate on a micro, meso and
   macro level perspective. Self-agency is undermined by factors including
   immigration policies and sociocultural perspectives that can lead to
   under-resourced and judgemental care, other intersectional factors can
   also lead to some individuals being more vulnerable to violence and
   harm. Conclusion: Implications from this work include strategies that
   emphasise woman-centred care, staff training and meaningful
   organisational change to optimise positive health and wellbeing.},

Title = {Regimes of truth regarding `sexual justice' in academic literature from
   2012 to 2022: a scoping review},
Journal = {CULTURE HEALTH \& SEXUALITY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 29},
Abstract = {The notion of `sexual justice' has gained traction in academic and
   policy arenas in recent years. This paper presents a scoping literature
   review of the regimes of truth, following Foucault, of `sexual justice'
   appearing in the scientific literature from 2012 to 2022. Thirty-eight
   papers were coded using (1) content analysis of the studies' central
   problematics, the programmes referred to, and institutional location(s);
   and (2) thematic analysis of how the notion was deployed. Central
   problematics centred on (1) critiques of, or alternatives to, dominant
   approaches to sexual and reproductive health; and (2) highlighting
   injustices. As such, `sexual justice' is fighting for legitimacy in the
   truth stakes. There is a distinct paucity of papers tackling the
   translation of `sexual justice' into practice. South Africa dominates as
   the site in which papers on `sexual justice' have been produced, but
   there is a lack of South-South collaboration. Two themes were apparent
   around which conceptions of sexual justice cohere. Firstly, sexual
   justice is seen as a vital, yet politically ambivalent goal, with
   neoliberal co-optation of progressive rights agendas being warned
   against. Secondly, sexual justice is viewed as a means, in which sexual
   justice is described as having potential to repair established
   frameworks' shortcomings and oppressive legacies.},

Title = {How to defeat miscarriage stigma: from `breaking the silence' to
   Reproductive Justice},
Journal = {FEMINIST THEORY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 26},
Abstract = {Public discussions of miscarriage in the UK frequently describe it as a
   stigmatised phenomenon that is `shrouded in silence'. And in turn,
   `breaking the silence' is presented as the means of defeating the
   stigma. In this article, however, I argue that it is time to abandon the
   `breaking the silence' frame. This is not only because it overstates the
   public silence it condemns, but also because it is rooted in an
   inadequate understanding of stigma, which keeps us stuck in a cycle of
   talking more, rather than doing more, about miscarriage, and failing to
   connect miscarriage as a feminist issue with wider struggles for social
   justice. Drawing on critical sociologies of stigma developed by Imogen
   Tyler and others, I propose a paradigm shift: from a narrow liberal
   understanding of miscarriage stigma as a problem of social norms that
   can be alleviated through `breaking the silence' and `awareness
   raising', to a critical `stigma power' approach which understands
   miscarriage stigma as a `machinery of inequality' that fulfils a core
   function for patriarchal, racialised, neoliberal capitalist power
   structures, and hence requires transformative socioeconomic solutions.
   To this end, I call for a new research and activism agenda that fully
   incorporates miscarriage within the wider movement for Reproductive
   Justice.},

Title = {Social Determinants of Health and Patient-Reported Difficult
   Discontinuation of Long-Acting Reversible Contraception},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 22},
Abstract = {Background: Some individuals who receive long-acting reversible
   contraception (LARC) face barriers to discontinuation. The inability to
   discontinue a contraceptive method when desired negatively impacts a
   person's reproductive autonomy. Persons impacted by social determinants
   of health (SDH) may be disproportionately affected. The objective of
   this study is to evaluate the association of SDH with patient-reported
   difficult LARC discontinuation.Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional
   analysis of data from the 2017-2019 cycle of the National Survey of
   Family Growth was conducted. The main outcome was patient-reported
   difficulty discontinuing a LARC method (intrauterine device or implant)
   in the last 10 years. Descriptive statistics were used to identify
   demographic characteristics and SDH domains. Multivariable logistic
   regression models were used to estimate associations across SDH domains
   with difficult LARC removal.Results: A total of 754 respondents reported
   wanting to have their LARC removed, and 105 (11\%) reported difficulty
   discontinuing LARC methods. One-third of respondents experienced one or
   more SDH, notably food insecurity (26\%) or transportation barriers
   (30\%). After adjusting for age, race, education, geographic location,
   parity, and body mass index (BMI), persons with one or more SDH had an
   increased adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for difficultly discontinuing LARCs
   compared with respondents without any SDH (2.11; 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI]: 1.21, 3.69). Transportation barriers demonstrated the
   largest aOR of 2.90 (95\% CI: 1.07, 7.87).Conclusions: SDH are
   associated with challenges to LARC discontinuation. SDH are unique risk
   factors that can impact one's entire contraceptive experience. A nuanced
   discussion of SDH at the time of contraceptive counseling may be a
   critical step in addressing the intersectionality of method selection
   and reproductive agency.},

Title = {Mass Incarceration, Maternal Vulnerability, and Birth Outcomes Across US
   Counties},
Journal = {MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH JOURNAL},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 16},
Abstract = {ObjectivesTo examine the associations among mass incarceration, maternal
   vulnerability, and disparities in birth outcomes across U.S. counties,
   utilizing an ecological model and reproductive justice perspective was
   used. This study tests whether mass incarceration is associated with
   infant mortality and low birthweight across U.S. counties, and whether
   maternal vulnerability explains the relationship between mass
   incarceration and birth disparities.MethodsData were derived from a
   variety of public sources and were merged using federal FIPS codes.
   Outcomes from the CDC Vitality Statistics include percent low birth
   weight births (births below 2499 g divided by singleton births to women
   aged 20 to 39) and infant mortality (infant deaths per 1000 live
   births). Black-White rate ratios were calculated for the birth outcomes
   to specifically examine the large Black-White disparity in birth
   outcomes. The analysis controlled for urbanicity, income inequality,
   median household income, residential segregation, and southern region,
   as well as a fixed effect for state level differences.ResultsFindings
   show that counties with higher rates of incarceration have higher
   prevalence of infant mortality and low birthweight, as well as greater
   Black-White disparity in infant mortality. Mass incarceration is
   associated with increases in adverse birth outcomes and maternal
   vulnerability partially mediates this relationship.ConclusionsFindings
   provide evidence that heightened levels of incarceration affect birth
   outcomes for all residents at the county-level. It is imperative to
   address the overuse of mass incarceration in order to support adequate
   reproductive healthcare of vulnerable populations in the United States.
   Previous research has found a negative realtionship exists between
   incarceration and population health, but the extent to which birth
   outcomes vary by incarceration rate at the county level are unknown.This
   study estimates associations between county-level rates of total
   incarceration, jail admission, and prison admission, on rates of infant
   mortality and low-birthweight. Results show that prevalence of
   low-birthweight and infant mortality are increased in U.S. counties with
   heightened incarceration rates and that this realtionship is partially
   mediated by maternal vulnerability, an estimation of risk for adverse
   pregnancy outcomes for women in the area. This stidy also found that
   mass incarceration contributes to the widening of Black-White
   disparities in infant mortality.},

   Domination{''} for the ``Cause of Virtue{''}},
Journal = {POLITICAL THEOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 13},
Abstract = {Wollstonecraft's name and work have been invoked repeatedly since Dobbs,
   not only because she wrote the first major political treatise defending
   women's rights but also because several leaders of the so-called
   ``prolife{''} movement have sought to reclaim the label ``feminist{''}
   by enlisting Wollstonecraft in the contemporary antiabortion,
   anticontraception, and heterosexual family-centered cause. The article
   challenges these anachronistic and revisionist histories, which ignore
   Wollstonecraft's life experiences and wider corpus. Especially in her
   late novel, The Wrongs of Woman, abortion is both a prominent metaphor
   for the book as a whole and a crucial narrative event for both heroines.
   I argue that Wollstonecraft's life, work, and ethical commitments,
   particularly her advocacy for ``rights against domination{''} and ``for
   the cause of virtue,{''} make her a fitting historical ally to
   contemporary advocates of reproductive justice who see women's rights to
   abortion and maternity as among the many important issues for women's
   health and reproductive justice.},

Title = {Treating <i>Mycoplasma genitalium</i> (in pregnancy): a social and
   reproductive justice concern},
Journal = {MONASH BIOETHICS REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 11},
Abstract = {Antimicrobial Resistance is a threat to individual and to population
   health and to future generations, requiring ``collective sacrifices{''}
   in order to preserve antibiotic efficacy. `Who should make the
   sacrifices?' and `Who will most likely make them?' are ethical concerns
   posited as potentially manageable through Antimicrobial Stewardship.
   Antimicrobial stewardship almost inevitably involves a form of clinical
   cost-benefit analysis that assesses the possible effects of antibiotics
   to treat a diagnosed infection in a particular patient. However, this
   process rarely accounts properly for patients - above and beyond
   assessments of potential (non)compliance or adherence to care regimes.
   Drawing on a vignette of a pregnant woman of colour and migrant
   diagnosed with Mycoplasma genitalium, a sexually transmissible
   bacterium, this article draws out some of the ethical, speculative, and
   practical tensions and complexities involved in Antimicrobial
   Stewardship. We argue that patients also engage in a form of
   cost-benefit analysis influenced by experiences of reproductive and
   social (in)justice and comprising speculative variables - to anticipate
   future possibilities. These processes have the potential to have effects
   above and beyond the specific infection antimicrobial stewardship was
   activated to address. We contend that efforts to practice and research
   antimicrobial stewardship should accommodate and incorporate these
   variables and acknowledge the structures they emerge with(in), even if
   their components remain unknown. This would involve recognising that
   antimicrobial stewardship is intricately connected to other social
   justice issues such as immigration policy, economic justice, access to
   appropriate medical care, racism, etc.},

Abstract = {In this critical commentary, we describe the many limitations of the
   pregnancy planning paradigm as applied to pregnant and parenting teens.
   We describe how this paradigm, in characterizing pregnancies as intended
   or unintended, has shaped campaigns to prevent teen pregnancy and
   remains largely embedded in formal sex education and family planning
   programs in the United States. We argue that a paradigm shift is long
   overdue and describe how the reproductive justice framework addresses
   the limitations of the pregnancy planning paradigm. Although
   reproductive justice is endorsed by a growing number of organizations,
   recommended policies face formidable obstacles given that comprehensive
   sex education, contraception, and legal abortion are increasingly at
   risk in a post- Dobbs world.},

Abstract = {This introductory essay argues that trans rhetorics are a crucial method
   for grappling with the speed, scope, and ascendance of contemporary
   fascism. Yet, rhetorical studies have yet to robustly engage with trans
   methodologies and epistemologies, a refusal with dire consequences for
   academic labor in this climate and the future of the field. Pushing
   against the scarcity logics that render ``trans issues{''} as
   ``niche{''} or a ``cultural war,{''} this essay develops a way of
   reading fascist energizing. Through the concept affective metabolism, I
   argue trans people are imagined as resources to exhaust, alongside
   others captured by grievance politics. Consequently, fascist energizing
   is a way of metabolizing fear into authoritarian control, with
   consequences for trans people alongside laborers in communities for
   reproductive justice, climate, and disability justice.},

   connections among queer/trans/disability frameworks of environmental,
   climate, and reproductive justice centered around community planning and
   county level democratic politics. We reflect on the lessons learned in
   our local context of Iowa between 2023-2024, during unprecedented
   legislative control of queer and trans lives and reproductive politics.
   In our conversation, we argue anti-trans legislation is a form of
   authoritarianism and political violence, a frame which shifts how
   organizers might draw connections among issues and energize future
   struggles. We reflect on the organizing strategies and advocacy work in
   our community and connect this labor as crucial care work necessary for
   queer and trans life.},

Abstract = {Accounts differ as to when it became clear that we would lose
   constitutional protections for the right to abortion. For some, it was
   on June 24, Organization was officially released. For others, it was on
   May 2 of that year, when what turned out to be a substantially complete
   draft of Justice Alito's majority opinion was leaked and published by
   Politico. It could have been effectively shuttering all the abortion
   clinics in the state. Or perhaps it was on May 17, 2021, when the court,
   with a newly constituted far-right plurality, granted review of
   Mississippi's blatantly unconstitutional abortion restriction. The
   dismantling of abortion rights promised by President Trump from the
   earliest days of his campaign was in the offing, and the interlocking
   networks of people dedicated to ensuring abortion access were
   preparing-with a mix of resolution and dread-for what would happen to
   the millions of people who need abortions in hostile states each year.
   In some corners of the community of legal activists, preparations were
   being made for the possibility-in fact, the practical inevitability-that
   people would be criminally prosecuted for their abortions. Not because
   overturning Roe would authorize such arrests, but because arrests for
   self-managed abortion have been an unfortunate reality for decades,
   regardless of both constitutional and state-level protections for
   abortion rights. In 2015, several small state, regional, and national
   gender justice organizations formed a consortium called the Self-Induced
   Abortion Legal},

Volume = {137},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {27-43},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Feminist scholars of reproductive justice argue for a broader model of
   politics organised around embodied experience. But to fully express the
   intersectional politics of reproductive justice, more attention must be
   given to the social function of embodiment-the ways that bodily markers
   create associative communities among strangers. This shared form of
   embodiment establishes connections that exceed the intimate relationship
   of a specific pregnancy. In particular, foetal embodiment manifests via
   communities with vested interest in the social meaning of life. These
   communities are affected, albeit indirectly, by reproductive choices and
   are therefore valid subjects of concern for reproductive justice. I
   develop the argument by focusing on disability, a specific form of
   embodiment where control over reproductive life is exercised not merely
   via state regulation of choice but also through social reproduction of
   normality. Engaging with foetal embodiment poses genuine risks-given
   popular arguments that link coercive regulations to the idea of `foetal
   personhood'. But these risks must be faced if reproductive justice is to
   be a truly intersectional project.},

Title = {Obstacles to Accepting Care: Understanding Why Obstetric Patients Leave
   against Medical Advice},
Journal = {MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH JOURNAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {28},

Abstract = {IntroductionDischarge ``against medical advice{''} (AMA) in the
   obstetric population is overall under-studied but disproportionally
   affects marginalized populations and is associated with worse perinatal
   outcomes. Reasons for discharges AMA are not well understood. The
   objective of this study is to identify the obstacles that prevent
   obstetric patients from accepting recommended care and highlight the
   structural reasons behind AMA discharges.MethodsElectronic health
   records of patients admitted to antepartum, peripartum, or postpartum
   services between 2008 and 2018 who left ``AMA{''} were reviewed.
   Progress notes from clinicians and social workers were extracted and
   analyzed. Reasons behind discharge were categorized using qualitative
   thematic analysis.ResultsFifty-seven (0.12\%) obstetric patients were
   discharged AMA. Reasons for discharge were organized into two
   overarching themes: extrinsic (50.9\%) and intrinsic (40.4\%) obstacles
   to accepting care. Eleven participants (19.3\%) had no reason documented
   for their discharge. Extrinsic obstacles included childcare, familial
   responsibilities, and other obligations. Intrinsic obstacles included
   disagreement with provider regarding medical condition or plan,
   emotional distress, mistrust or discontent with care team, and substance
   use.DiscussionThe term ``AMA{''} casts blame on individual patients and
   fails to represent the systemic barriers to staying in care. Obstetric
   patients were found to encounter both extrinsic and intrinsic obstacles
   that led them to leave AMA. Healthcare providers and institutions can
   implement strategies that ameliorate structural barriers. Partnering
   with patients to prevent discharges AMA would improve maternal and
   infant health and progress towards reproductive justice.
   What is Already Known on this Subject?Obstetric patients who leave
   ``against medical advice (AMA){''} have worse perinatal outcomes and
   often are from marginalized communities. The term, AMA, is also
   stigmatizing, placing blame on individual decision making rather than
   systemic barriers to access. Reasons for leaving AMA are not well
   understood in the obstetric population.What does this Study add?We
   reframe the discussion around leaving AMA by describing obstacles in
   accepting care. Patients experienced both extrinsic and intrinsic
   obstacles to accepting medical care, from childcare issues to
   disagreement with treatment plan. Partnering with patients to overcome
   these obstacles would improve maternal and infant health and increase
   equity and reproductive justice.},

   Debates on Social Media},
Journal = {HEALTH COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUN 28},
Abstract = {In China, unmarried women are prohibited from egg freezing despite high
   demand and declining fertility rates. Within such a context, this
   article aims to examine public attitudes toward reproduction and
   egg-freezing on social media, with particular attention paid to how
   these discussions reflect the multi-level determinants influencing
   decision-making regarding egg-freezing practices. Within the context of
   Chinese gender ideology, we conducted a critical discourse analysis of
   1,437 Weibo posts discussing egg-freezing. Our analysis identified four
   significant themes: reconstructing romantic relationships and family
   structures, conspiracy theories and distrust surrounding assisted
   reproduction, exposing and challenging reproductive policies within a
   patriarchal framework, and interconnections and stratification among
   women. Accentuated by the egg-freezing discourse, we argue that current
   Chinese women's bodily autonomy is entangled with traditional norms and
   state control, underscoring the intricate interplay between individual
   choice and societal dynamics, as well as the ideological contradictions
   at the intersection of Western technological influence and Chinese
   societal structures. Furthermore, we illuminate the challenging
   landscape faced by online feminist movements within such a complex
   context. Our findings set the stage for shaping future initiatives
   focused on advancing reproductive justice and empowering fertility
   choices among Chinese women.},

Abstract = {The article applies the concept of stratified reproduction to analyse
   experiences of women with disabilities in Poland. Stratified
   reproduction - rewarding motherhood for some and disempowering others
   from being parents - and its relation to ableism is explored in a
   country context, where reproductive rights struggles are prevalent in
   the public sphere. Based on qualitative empirical research (in-depth
   semi-structured interviews and focus group interviews) with 50 women
   with disabilities, the article shows that women with disabilities are
   subjected to mechanisms of social control that limit their reproductive
   decision-making and discourage them from becoming parents. Social
   control is explored in the context of withdrawal of information about
   reproductive health and sexuality, navigating access and fear of custody
   deprivation based on ableist presumptions. The ambivalence between
   social expectations related to parenthood versus performing care work is
   explored. The analysis shows that women with disabilities navigate
   exclusionary norms and challenge understandings of who can become a
   parent and who can make decisions about who can become a parent. This
   article offers the concept of stratified reproduction to explain the
   structural inequalities experienced by women with disabilities with
   regard to reproduction, and highlights the importance of studying
   ableism as an essential factor within the reproductive realm.},

Title = {``Because I Was a Criminal and Drug Addict.{''}: Experiences of
   Anti-Black Gendered Racism and Reproductive Injustice Among Black
   Pregnant and Postpartum Women with a Substance Use Disorder and
   Incarceration and Family Policing Histories},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC HEALTH DISPARITIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUN 11},
Abstract = {Racism pervades the US criminal legal and family policing systems,
   particularly impacting cases involving women with a history of a
   substance use disorder (SUD). Laws criminalizing SUD during pregnancy
   disproportionately harm Black women, as do family policing policies
   around family separation. Discrimination within intersecting systems may
   deter Black pregnant women with a SUD from seeking evidence-based
   pregnancy and substance use care. This convergent parallel mixed-methods
   study aimed to illuminate how systemic oppression influenced the lived
   experiences of Black mothers with a SUD, facing dual involvement in the
   criminal legal and family policing systems. Using convenience and
   snowball sampling techniques, we recruited 15 Black mothers who were
   incarcerated, used substances while pregnant, and had a history with
   family policing systems. We conducted semi-structured interviews and
   developed and distributed a scale questionnaire to describe
   participants' experiences navigating overlapping systems of surveillance
   and control. Drawing on models of systemic anti-Black racism and sexism
   and reproductive justice, we assessed participants' experiences of
   racism and gender-based violence within these oppressive systems.
   Participants described how intersecting systems of surveillance and
   control impeded their prenatal care, recovery, and abilities to parent
   their children in gender and racially specific ways. Although they
   mostly detailed experiences of interpersonal discriminatory treatment,
   particularly from custody staff while incarcerated and pregnant,
   participants highlighted instances of systemic anti-Black gendered
   racism and obstetric racism while accessing prenatal care and substance
   use treatment in carceral and community settings. Their narratives
   emphasize the need for action to measure and address the upstream
   macro-level systems perpetuating inequities.},

Abstract = {Separation at birth due to safeguarding concerns is a deeply distressing
   and impactful event, with numbers rising across the world, and has
   devastating outcomes for birth mothers and their children. It is one of
   the most challenging aspects of contemporary midwifery practice in
   high-income countries, although rarely discussed and reflected on during
   pre- and post-registration midwifery training. Ethnic and racial
   disparities are prevalent both in child protection and maternity
   services and can be explained through an intersectional lens, accounting
   for biases based on race, gender, class, and societal beliefs around
   motherhood. With this paper, we aim to contribute to the growing body of
   critical midwifery studies and re-think the role of midwives in this
   context. Building on principles of reproductive justice theory,
   Intersectionality, and Standpoint Midwifery, we argue that midwives play
   a unique role when supporting women who go through child protection
   processes and should pursue a shift from passive bystander to active
   upstander to improve care for this group of mothers.
   Separation between mother and baby shortly after birth due to
   safeguarding concerns is a deeply distressing and traumatising event,
   for all involved. We investigated the prevalence and incidence of infant
   separation and its impact on mothers and babies. Building on principles
   of Reproductive Justice Theory, Intersectionality and Standpoint
   Midwifery, we critically reviewed the role of midwives in this complex

   Court decision in R. v. Morgentaler, which deemed the existing federal
   abortion law unconstitutional, Canada has operated without criminal
   restrictions on abortion. Despite the distinctive nature of Canada's
   approach, there is a dearth of scholarly work that has explicitly traced
   the process through which abortion decriminalization materialized and
   offered an in-depth examination of its effectiveness. This paper aims to
   address this gap in two ways. First, it traces the process through which
   abortion decriminalization emerged in Canada, which resulted from a
   combination of context-specific circumstances and sociopolitical
   factors. Second, it argues that while Canada's pathway to abortion
   decriminalization is distinct and may not be directly transferable to
   other contexts, there are nonetheless insights to be drawn from the
   Canadian experience. The promise of abortion decriminalization, as both
   a governance and advocacy framework, lies in its efficacy, its ability
   to navigate constraints of the law, and its strategic and symbolic
   advantages.},

Abstract = {In recent years, health-data-driven artificial intelligence and machine
   learning applications have been introduced to many areas of medicine. In
   the field of assisted reproduction, artificial intelligence and machine
   learning applications and related technologies have been hailed as
   (potentially) significant and ground-breaking, not least because they
   promise standardisation and automation in in-vitro fertilisation clinics
   - a precondition for scaling up and branching out in the fertility
   bioindustry. Artificial intelligence data-driven algorithms promise
   time- and cost-effective selection of `high-quality' reproductive cells
   and successful personalised treatments. In this essay, we aim to
   critically discuss artificial intelligence as a technological clinical
   practice, which is currently moving from bench to bedside
   internationally. Through an analytic framework of reproductive justice,
   we propose that introducing artificial intelligence into this already
   stratified context threatens to black-box health disparities and to
   generate what we refer to as `hyper-stratifications' of reproduction in
   the context of rising health and social disparities in the European
   context. As feminist, social science and bioethics scholars, we are all
   too aware of how reproductive technologies reinforce normativities
   rather than unravel them. We cannot presume that artificial intelligence
   is an ethical technological agent or user of health data but, instead,
   need to keep a critical eye on the moral ambivalence of emerging and
   evolving artificial intelligence-assisted reproduction technologies
   practices and their gendered consequences. Given the current hype around
   artificial intelligence, but also with concerns around the fast
   development and deployment of artificial intelligence generally and in
   artificial intelligence-assisted reproduction technologies particularly
   in mind, there is an urgent need to engage in critical feminist
   discussion of such developments.},

Title = {Increasing access to LARC removal in pediatrics to support adolescent
   reproductive justice in the United States},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES ON SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {56},
Number = {2},
Pages = {85-89},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {BackgroundIn the United States (U.S.), adolescents and young adults are
   increasingly using contraception, including long-acting reversible
   contraception (LARC) {[}e.g., subdermal implants (e.g., Nexplanon (R))
   and intrauterine devices (IUDs)]; however, access to LARC device removal
   may be difficult for adolescents and young adults. Reproductive justice
   is the right to bodily autonomy, have children, not have children, and
   safely parent the children we have. MethodsIn this commentary, we
   discuss that while the specialties of family medicine and obstetrics and
   gynecology have incorporated the principles of reproductive justice into
   their contraceptive care, further work is needed to ingrain this
   philosophy into pediatrics training. Since LARC devices are historically
   only removable by health care providers, pediatricians may act as
   gatekeepers to removing LARC, obstructing the reproductive justice of
   adolescents and young adults. ResultsWe describe that adolescents and
   young adults in the U.S. face unique barriers to LARC removal including
   limited access to the health care system, potential breaches in
   confidentiality, and provider bias. These barriers may lead adolescents
   and young adults to remove their own LARC device when experiencing
   unwanted side effects or desiring pregnancy. While IUD self-removal is a
   safe and accessible option, safety and efficacy data on subdermal
   implant self-removal is currently limited. ConclusionIn order to promote
   reproductive justice in adolescents and young adults, we recommend that
   (1) pediatricians should address potential barriers to LARC removal
   prior to insertion, (2) pediatricians must offer unbiased LARC removal,
   (3) pediatricians who place LARC must be knowledgeable about complicated
   LARC removal, and (4) pediatricians should discuss LARC self-removal
   options with adolescents and young adults.},

Abstract = {Objective:The objective of this scoping review is to identify,
   categorize, and map the types of support and services available to
   at-risk mothers and their children in maternity residences. A secondary
   objective is to identify and map the measures used to evaluate the
   efficacy of these types of support and services.Introduction:Pregnant
   and parenting women and their children experiencing complex challenges
   related to the social determinants of health, including unstable housing
   and poverty, are at high risk of long-term negative health and
   socioeconomic outcomes. Maternity residences may provide support and
   services that improve this population's outcomes; however, there is
   little understanding of what services are offered and how efficacious
   they may be. Therefore, it is necessary to provide a comprehensive
   overview of support and services in maternity residences, and to
   identify the measures used to evaluate the efficacy of the support and
   services. This will provide the foundation to evaluate these services
   and outcomes and inform the development of future maternity residential
   programs.Inclusion criteria:Studies including pregnant and parenting
   women and gender-diverse individuals who are housed in, or accessing the
   services of, maternity residences in politically stable high-income
   countries due to challenges rooted in the social determinants of health
   will be considered for inclusion. We define maternity residences as any
   agency with a residential component offering support/services to this
   populationMethods:This review will be conducted in accordance with JBI
   methodology for scoping reviews. The data will be analyzed using a
   quantitative descriptive analysis approach. The data analysis and
   discussion will be informed by the Social Determinants of Health,
   Reproductive Justice, Harm Reduction, and Health in All Policies

Title = {Reproductive Control as a Carceral Tool of the State - Understanding
   Eugenics in a Post-<i> Roe</i> Society},
Journal = {CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {112},
Pages = {969-1000},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The government has used reproductive control as a carceral tool for
   centuries, especially against women of color. While scholars anticipate
   the overturn of Roe v. Wade will exacerbate state surveillance and
   control over pregnancy, the current ``pro-choice{''} rhetoric neglects
   the state's history of policing reproduction through forced
   sterilization programs, fetal protection laws, and criminal prosecutions
   against pregnant persons and caregivers dependent on narcotics. Without
   a complete understanding of this history and the intersectionality of
   race, gender, socioeconomic status, disability, and crime, reproductive
   liberation is not possible. Thus, this Note aims to contribute to
   existing reproductive justice scholarship and advocacy efforts of women
   and gender-nonconforming people of color by contextualizing the overturn
   of Roe within the history of racial eugenics and reproductive
   punishment. In doing so, this Note uses the history of eugenics and
   state-sanctioned reproductive oppression to show that abortion is not
   ``a tool of modern-day eugenics,{''} as conservatives inaccurately
   proclaim. Adopting a reproductive justice framework is necessary to
   realize true reproductive freedom.},

Title = {Feminist Fertility Awareness? Sexual and Reproductive Knowledge in a
   Post-<i>Roe</i> World},

Volume = {49},

Abstract = {In the United States, access to contraception and abortion care is
   limited by policy makers aligned with conservative religious positions,
   which are often specifically Catholic or Evangelical Christian. In this
   post-Roe political climate, activists, policy makers, voters, and
   everyday individuals are responding to the loss of legal authority over
   one's body. This article analyzes fertility awareness methods,
   contraceptive practices also known as ``natural family planning.{''} I
   explore the feminist health history of fertility awareness methods to
   enhance body knowledge and how these methods differ from the Catholic
   Church's antiabortion position promoting natural family planning. This
   study is based on materials collected from the 1960s to the present on
   fertility awareness methods and natural family planning from feminist,
   Catholic, and global public health perspectives. I selected the 1960s
   due to the confluence of social changes: the organizing of a feminist
   health movement, the marketing of the contraceptive pill, and shifts in
   Catholic teachings. By charting the multiple meanings of fertility
   awareness methods, I highlight their potential as a full-body health
   strategy that can withstand multiple challenges to sexual and
   reproductive care. In line with reproductive justice goals, fertility
   awareness methods assist both those who are trying not to conceive and
   those who are trying to conceive, and unlike mainstream contraceptive
   technologies, they build networks of people practicing fertility
   awareness. Although fertility awareness methods are controversial
   because some feminist health advocates interpret them as undermining
   support for all contraceptives and aligning with an antiabortion agenda,
   I advocate for a visible, dynamic, inclusive feminist framing of these
   methods.},

Abstract = {Effective communication in relation to pregnancy and birth is crucial to
   quality care. A recent focus in reproductive healthcare on ``sexed
   language{''} reflects an ideology of unchangeable sex binary and fear of
   erasure, from both cisgender women and the profession of midwifery. In
   this paper, we highlight how privileging sexed language causes harm to
   all who birth-including pregnant trans, gender diverse, and non-binary
   people-and is, therefore, unethical and incompatible with the principles
   of midwifery. We show how this argument, which conflates midwifery with
   essentialist thinking, is unstable, and perpetuates and misappropriates
   midwifery's marginalized status. We also explore how sex and gender
   essentialism can be understood as colonialist, heteropatriarchal, and
   universalist, and therefore, reinforcing of these harmful principles.
   Midwifery has both the opportunity and duty to uphold reproductive
   justice. Midwifery can be a leader in the decolonization of childbirth
   and in defending the rights of all childbearing people, the majority of
   whom are cisgender women. As the systemwide use of inclusive language is
   central to this commitment, we offer guidance in relation to how
   inclusive language in perinatal and midwifery services may be realized.

   online framings of IUD self-removal},
Journal = {CULTURE HEALTH \& SEXUALITY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUN 1},
Abstract = {This article examines how intrauterine device (IUD) self-removal is
   framed in online sources containing the views of contraceptive
   providers. While research has explored power and knowledge hierarchies
   in clinical interactions between contraceptive users and providers, and
   has highlighted the safety of IUD self-removal, little is known about
   how self-removal is represented by providers in accessible online
   sources that may be relied upon by contraceptive users for information.
   A discourse analysis of 42 provider-generated online sources found that
   provider authority over contraception is reinforced through biomedical
   constructions of risk and safety in framings of self-removal. The data
   reveal how the sharing of self-removal experiences between IUD users via
   online platforms was perceived to threaten contraceptive provider
   expertise, resulting in the dismissal of users' experiential knowledge.
   While some sources were supportive, the framings of self-removal
   discussed in this paper typically mirror the unequal power relations of
   in-person contraceptive user/provider interactions. The sources analysed
   therefore demonstrate how power and knowledge hierarchies are reproduced
   and extend beyond clinical interactions to the digital context,
   reflecting broader socio-structural controls over bodies, knowledge, and
   reproductive decision-making.},

Title = {Ethical Considerations in Expanding Eligibility Criteria for Uterus
   Transplant Recipients: A Scoping Review},
Journal = {TRANSGENDER HEALTH},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAY 29},
Abstract = {Purpose: As uterine transplantation (UTx) shifts from an experimental
   fertility treatment toward standard of care, ethical considerations in
   expanding access to UTx beyond currently eligible recipients merit
   attention. We conducted a scoping review to map existing scholarship on
   the ethics of candidacy for UTx beyond cisgender female
   recipients.Methods: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for
   Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews
   (PRISMA-ScR), five databases were searched (PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase,
   Scopus, and CINAHL) from database inception to June 24, 2022. Following
   title, abstract, and full-text screening, data were extracted and
   charted to identify thematic patterns and identify gaps in
   scholarship.Results: Thirty-two articles were included in the final
   sample. Issues of justice figured most prominently. Common themes
   included the right to gestate for transgender women and beyond, the
   possibility of increased surgical and medical risks for other recipient
   populations, and attendant moral obligation to expand access to UTx if
   additive risks are mitigated. Equity considerations were also frequently
   cited, along with the value of gestation in female identity and its role
   in defining womanhood.Conclusion: Discourse on the ethics of expanding
   eligibility for UTx is still emerging. Areas for further consideration
   include exploring the relation of gestation to identity and gender,
   clarifying the need for further research on safety and efficacy of UTx
   in other recipient populations, assessing desire for UTx among
   individuals other than cisgender women, and addressing sustainable
   funding. This scoping review can inform efforts to develop equitable
   eligibility criteria for access to UTx moving forward.},

Title = {What Hath Dobbs Wrought? Abortion activism in precarious and punitive
   times},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENDER STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAY 26},
Abstract = {In June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health
   Organization (2022) overturned Roe v. Wade (1973), abolishing the
   constitutional right to abortion. Significant in its radical
   criminalization of abortion, Dobbs reinvigorated feminist activism for
   reproductive justice. Digital and mobile technologies are used in
   innovative ways by activists to organize, educate, and dispel
   counter-narratives about abortion, including feminist global networks
   that provide medication abortion and abortion storytelling through
   social media and media interventions. There continue to be analogue
   interventions that are the legacy of the 1960's-era Jane Collective. In
   this vexatious legal environment, the communication technologies that
   facilitate abortion activism are weaponized by restrictionist actors to
   not only misinform, but also, through abortion surveillance, to track
   and curtail access to reproductive care by tapping into and exploiting
   what we term the personal data economy of reproductive health. Activists
   are thus countering the surveillant assemblages engaged by
   restrictionist states whose objective is to criminalize abortion access
   and care across borders. This article considers the historical and
   current media ecology surrounding reproductive health, care and justice,
   the technologies that have and continue to shape it, and the array of
   analogue, digital, mobile and hybrid feminist activist interventions
   emerging post-Roe.},

Title = {Positioning sexual justice within social work teaching on human rights:
   countering contemporary sexuality oppression},
Journal = {SOCIAL WORK EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAY 26},
Abstract = {Access to sexual health, sexuality information, sexual expression and
   sexual pleasure is a human right. Yet, the sexual health and wellness
   landscape has become a battlefield. Recently large-scale sex-negative
   campaigns preceded the US Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022.
   The use of the word `gay' was restricted in public schools along with
   efforts to ban drag queen story time. Further reports of increased
   violence against people who identify as transgender have increased.
   Given social work's roots as an anti-oppressive, practice-based
   profession focused on social justice, social workers are ideally
   positioned to challenge this attack on sexual rights, sexual pleasure,
   and access to related services. Sexual justice pedagogy is a warranted
   first step. A review of the literature establishes the rationale behind
   sexuality being a human right, examining social work's missed
   opportunities for sexual justice. Next, the current sexuality assault
   landscape in the US is reviewed and sexual justice is defined within
   social justice. Activities are presented providing educators exemplars
   to introduce sexual justice content in human rights teaching. I conclude
   with recommendations to create a learning environment that will help
   facilitate the understanding and integration of sexual justice within
   the teaching of human rights to social work students.},

Abstract = {African American mothers are unjustly burdened by both residential
   evictions and psychological distress. We quantified associations between
   trajectories of neighborhood evictions over time and the odds of
   moderate and serious psychological distress (MPD and SPD, respectively)
   during pregnancy among African American women. We linked publicly
   available data on neighborhood eviction filing and judgment rates to
   preconception and during-pregnancy addresses from the Life-course
   Influences on Fetal Environments (LIFE) Study (2009-2011; n = 808).
   Multinomial logistic regression-estimated odds of MPD and SPD during
   pregnancy that were associated with eviction filing and judgment rate
   trajectories incorporating preconception and during-pregnancy addresses
   (each categorized as low, medium, or high, with two 9-category
   trajectory measures). Psychological distress was measured with the
   Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6) (K6 scores 5-12 = MPD, and K6
   scores >= 13 = SPD). MPD was reported in 60\% of the sample and SPD in
   8\%. In adjusted models, higher neighborhood eviction filing and
   judgment rates, as compared with low/low rates, during the preconception
   and pregnancy periods were associated with 2- to 4-fold higher odds of
   both MPD and SPD during pregnancy among African American women. In
   future studies, researchers should identify mechanisms of these findings
   to inform timely community-based interventions and effective policy
   solutions to ensure the basic human right to housing for all.This

Abstract = {IntroductionNon-Hispanic Black women and their infants experience the
   worst pregnancy-related outcomes in the United States. Social safety is
   a health-relevant resource found in environments communicating safety,
   connectedness, inclusion, and protection. Approaches promoting social
   safety may be particularly relevant to preventing adverse perinatal
   health outcomes among Black women. However, there remains a lack of
   conceptual clarity. The purpose of this concept analysis was to provide
   a theoretical clarification of the concept social safety for Black women
   within perinatal health care.MethodsPubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL were
   searched using Boolean search strategy. Retrieved articles were managed
   in Zotero. Duplicates were removed, and each article was assessed and
   categorized by both investigators. Articles reporting Black women's
   perinatal health care experiences were included. Thematic analysis
   guided by Rodgers' evolutionary method identified defining attributes,
   antecedents, and consequences of social safety in perinatal care for
   Black women.ResultsSocial safety for Black women is defined as the
   process of feeling understood, respected, cared for, and in control in
   perinatal health care settings that make space, care for, and recognize
   strengths, thereby cultivating safety and empowerment.DiscussionSocial
   safety offers actionable insights for practice and research that have
   the potential to drive positive change in perinatal care delivery for
   Black women. Developing interventions and measurements that are valid,
   reliable, and reflect social safety are essential to promote positive
   experiences and equity in health care practices and policies.},

Title = {Gendering Toxic Contamination: Toxic Risks, Bodies, and Pregnancies in
   Gold Mining and Coca Farming Communities in the Bajo Cauca Region},
Journal = {ANTIPODE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {56},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper investigates women's everyday reproductive struggles in
   contexts of toxic contamination and the tensions emerging between toxic
   exposure and care in women's experiences of motherhood. While scientific
   framings of reproductive disruptions understand social identities as
   pre-existing the experience of toxic risks, in this paper I argue that,
   in toxic territories, the categories of ``contaminating{''} and
   ``contaminated{''} actors interact with other categories of identity,
   such as gender and race, shaping social relations. Drawing on 13 months
   of ethnographic fieldwork conducted in the Bajo Cauca region among gold
   mining and coca farming communities, I investigate the everyday
   processes of gendered subject formation that unfold in toxic territories
   and the emergence of ``faulty{''} gendered identities for rural mothers.
   Building on scholarship in feminist geography and Latin American
   feminist science and technology studies, I argue that ineffective forms
   of integration of gender in the institutional debate on toxic
   contamination reproduce, rather than challenge, the invisibility of
   rural women before the state.
   Este articulo analiza los desaf \& iacute;os reproductivos de las
   mujeres en contextos de contaminaci \& oacute;n t \& oacute;xica y las
   tensiones que emergen entre la exposici \& oacute;n t \& oacute;xica y
   las practicas de cuidado en sus experiencias de maternidad. Mientras los
   discursos cient \& iacute;ficos sobre contaminaci \& oacute;n
   conceptualizan las identidades sociales como preexistentes a la
   experiencia de riesgos t \& oacute;xicos, en este articulo argumento que
   las categor \& iacute;as de actores sociales ``contaminados{''} y ``que
   contaminan{''} interaccionan con otras categor \& iacute;as de identidad
   como el g \& eacute;nero y la raza, influenciando las relaciones
   sociales. Con base en 13 meses de trabajo de campo etnogr \& aacute;fico
   en la subregi \& oacute;n del Bajo Cauca con comunidades cocaleras y
   mineras, investigo los procesos cotidianos de formaci \& oacute;n de
   subjetividades de g \& eacute;nero que se desarrollan en territorios t
   \& oacute;xicos y la construcci \& oacute;n de una identidad
   ``defectuosa{''} impuesta a las madres rurales. El articulo contribuye a
   los debates en la geograf \& iacute;a feminista y los estudios
   feministas latinoamericanos de Ciencia y Tecnolog \& iacute;a,
   argumentando que las formas en las que el g \& eacute;nero ha sido
   integrado en el debate institucional sobre contaminaci \& oacute;n t \&
   oacute;xica reproduce, en vez de desafiar, la invisibilidad de las
   mujeres rurales frente al estado.},

   Women's Prisons and the Violent Legacy of Eugenics},
Journal = {SOCIETIES},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Prisons in the United States serve as a site and embodiment of gendered
   and racialized state violence. The US incarcerates more people than any
   other nation in both numbers and per capita rates. Individuals
   incarcerated in women's prisons are 10\% of the total prison population,
   yet women's prisons remain understudied, and the violence that occurs in
   women's facilities is rampant, widespread, and operates in particular
   racialized and gendered ways. This paper centers the forced
   sterilizations that occurred in California state prisons over the last
   two decades. We consider how reproduction and the nuclear family have
   served as a primary site of racial capitalism and eugenic ideology.
   While eugenic policies were popularized and promoted across the US and
   globally in the 20th century, the violent ideas underlying eugenic
   ideology have been a constant presence throughout US history. The height
   of the eugenics era is marked by the forcible sterilization of
   institutionalized `deviant' bodies. While discussions of eugenics often
   center these programs, the reach of eugenic policies extends far beyond
   surgical interventions. We utilize a reproductive justice lens to argue
   that the hierarchical, racialized social stratification necessary for
   the existence of prisons constructs and sustains the `deviant' bodies
   and families that predicate eugenic logic, policies, and practices. In
   this conceptual paper, we draw from ongoing research to argue that
   prisons, as institutions and as a product of racial capitalism,
   perpetuate the ongoing violent legacy of eugenics and name abolition as
   a central component of the fight to end reproductive oppression.},

Abstract = {The preconception consultation has traditionally centered pregnancy as
   desired and preordained. Separating preconception and contraceptive
   visits burdens patients and further fragments reproductive healthcare.
   We argue that the creation of a combined preconception and complex
   contraception clinic for individuals with signi ficant medical and
   obstetrical comorbidities is one approach to promoting reproductive
   autonomy. Pregnancy planning, prevention, and risk evaluation clinics
   are designed to review pregnancy-related risks in the setting of
   patients ` medical and obstetrical comorbidities, recommend strategies
   to reduce risks, and, if desired, provide contraceptive methods.
   Consultations for pregnancy risk evaluation and pregnancy prevention
   should not be considered mutually exclusive. Combining these visits is
   crucial for obstetrically and/or medically complex patients. Rethinking
   the traditional preconception consultation is a change in healthcare
   delivery that centers comprehensive reproductive healthcare.},

Title = {Navigating Homelessness Assistance While Pregnant: A Rapid Qualitative
   Research-to-Policy Collaboration in Washington, DC},
Journal = {HEALTH EQUITY},

Abstract = {Background: Homelessness during pregnancy contributes to adverse
   pregnancy and infant outcomes from birth through early childhood.
   Washington, DC, a microcosm of structural inequities in the United
   States, has persistent racial disparities in perinatal outcomes and
   housing insecurity.Methods: Grounded in a reproductive justice
   framework, we explored the lived experience of navigating homelessness
   assistance while pregnant to inform recommendations for a collaborative
   policy and practice change effort. We conducted 20 individual interviews
   with DC residents who experienced homelessness during pregnancy. We
   analyzed the data using thematic analysis and an action-oriented
   approach.Results: Our analysis resulted in three main recommendation
   areas for policy and practice change: (1) timely and meaningful access
   to safe and stable housing in pregnancy; (2) care coordination for
   services and referrals that support physical, mental, and social
   well-being; and (3) access to a living wage and affordable
   housing.Discussion: Access to stable housing is critical to ensure that
   pregnant and parenting people can have and raise children in a safe and
   sustainable environment-key tenets of reproductive justice. Housing
   support must be meaningfully accessible, including service delivery that
   accommodates the complex social histories and competing demands that
   accompany housing insecurity.Health Equity Implications: This study
   informed the development of strategic recommendations, catalyzed a new
   model for multisector collaboration, and influenced a system-wide
   practice change to expand access to robust housing supports for pregnant
   people. Policy and practice change require sustained leveraging of
   political will to promote economic justice and ensure that residents can
   achieve safe, sustainable, and affordable housing.},

Abstract = {Objective:The objective of this review is to identify factors, tools,
   and interventions related to counselor biases and contraceptive
   counseling in women.Introduction:Contraceptive counseling is the
   transfer of knowledge regarding contraceptive methods to aid an
   individual in selecting, discontinuing, or changing contraception. The
   counselor should deliver information based on the patient's needs and
   preferences. The type and quality of the contraceptive information women
   are provided should not vary based on social or physical factors, such
   as age, race, religion, sexual orientation, education level, sexual
   preference, or weight; however, professional bias continues to be a
   concern in health care. The results of this review may further the
   understanding of counselor bias and contraceptive counseling.Inclusion
   criteria:This scoping review will consider studies that include health
   care professionals providing contraceptive counseling to female patients
   in any setting or geographic location. Studies reporting on factors,
   tools, and interventions related to counselor bias and contraceptive
   counseling will be included.Methods:Databases to be searched are
   MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, JBI
   Evidence-based Practice Database, Europe PubMed Central, and Cochrane
   Library. Sources of gray literature will include ProQuest Dissertations
   and Theses, PaperFirst, and MedNar. The review will include studies
   published in English from 1994 onward and follow the JBI methodology for
   scoping reviews. Two independent reviewers will screen the titles and
   abstracts, then full texts. Data from relevant studies will be extracted
   using a tool created by the reviewers. The results will be presented as
   a narrative summary and in diagrammatic or tabular format.Review

Abstract = {This review aims to disclose the gaps and needs for acknowledging the
   rights to experience motherhood of women with disabilities. To do so, we
   map how much is known about these women's experience with motherhood,
   shedding light on their sexual and reproductive rights. The present work
   followed the scoping review by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI). This
   research is structured by elaborating the question, identifying the
   relevant studies, selecting the studies, extracting the data, sorting,
   summarizing, and creating reports based on the results. Results: we
   found 1050 articles, of which 53 were selected for the analysis.
   considering the different themes, we generated three axes: (1)
   infantilization, dehumanization, and discredit in the experience of
   motherhood; (2) obstetric ableism - an expression of violence in
   obstetrics; (3) reproductive justice - politicize motherhood and care.
   The study showed the urgent need to regard women with disabilities as
   people having the right to make sexual and reproductive health choices.
   Health professionals need permanent education to acknowledge and
   guarantee such a need as interweaving relationships to reach decision
   -making and autonomy.},

Title = {Student Perceptions of Reproductive Health Consequences Resulting from
   Rape},
Journal = {SOCIOLOGICAL INQUIRY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 26},
Abstract = {Persistently high rates of campus rape combined with changing legal
   landscapes surrounding reproductive health make student perceptions of
   the reproductive health consequences resulting from rape an important
   topic of research. In this study, we analyze student perceptions of a
   hypothetical campus rape in which a victim experiences no medical
   consequences, becomes pregnant, or contracts a sexually transmitted
   infection (STI) as a result of rape. Students in the sample recommended
   consistently severe punishment for the perpetrator across all three
   experimental conditions but viewed victim guilt and responsibility to be
   greatest for the rape resulting in pregnancy and least for the rape
   resulting in an STI. Qualitatively, students voiced strong sympathy for
   the victim due to the STI, yet rarely discussed the impact of pregnancy.
   We recommend that future research investigate the perceptions,
   prevalence, and consequences of reproductive health outcomes resulting
   from campus rape and suggest a reproductive justice framework for doing
   so.},

Abstract = {Objective: To understand the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on abortion
   care-seeking in Maryland, a state with Medicaid coverage for abortion,
   high service availability, and laws supporting abortion rights. Methods:
   We conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with 15 women who had
   an abortion between January 2021 and March 2022 at a hospital-based
   clinic in a mid-sized Maryland city. We purposively recruited
   participants with varied pandemic financial impacts. Interview questions
   prompted participants to reflect on how the pandemic affected their
   lives, pregnancy decisions, and experiences seeking abortion care. We
   analyzed our data for themes. Results: All participants had some
   insurance coverage for their abortion; over half paid using Medicaid.
   Many participants experienced pandemic financial hardship, with several
   reporting job, food, and housing insecurity as circumstances influencing
   their decision to have an abortion. Most women who self-reported minimal
   financial hardship caused by the pandemic indicated they sought an
   abortion for reasons unrelated to COVID-19. In contrast, women with
   economic hardship viewed their pregnancies as unsupportable due to
   COVID-19 exacerbating financial instability, even when they desired to
   continue the pregnancy. All participants expressed that having an
   abortion was the best decision for their lives. Yet, when making
   decisions about their pregnancy, the most financially disadvantaged
   women weighed their desires against the pandemic's constraints on their
   reproductive self-determination. Conclusions: The pandemic changed
   abortion care-seeking circumstances even in a setting with minimal
   access barriers. Financial hardship influenced some women to have an
   abortion for a pregnancy that-while unplanned-they may have preferred to
   continue.},

Title = {Compassion, Female Victimhood and Abortion Legalization in Postcolonial
   India: Tracing Epistemic Heterogeneity in Abortion Politics},
Journal = {SOUTH ASIAN REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 22},
Abstract = {This paper provides a revised history of an understudied event in the
   trajectory of Indian political modernity - the moment of the
   legalization of abortion in 1971. The existing scholarship on the event
   reads it as one that was motivated purely by a developmentalist vision
   of a modernizing postcolonial elite, to the extent that the latter
   regarded increases in human numbers as hindrance to economic growth and
   identified abortion-legalization as a key solution to this quandary.
   While merited, such interpretations do not account for the varied
   techniques of persuasion mobilized by the parliamentarians/ lawmakers
   responsible for debating the laws. With the help of extensive archival
   analysis of the parliamentary debates, the paper shows how the modes of
   reasoning put forth in these debates were not always pegged to a
   developmentalist paradigm but rather made unequivocal use of a
   heterogeneous idiom of ``compassion{''} for the woman, victimized by
   male irresponsibility, to ground its case. The lawmakers' mobilization
   of this concept further recognized that the victimized pregnant woman's
   standpoint is epistemically inaccessible/ incommensurable to those who
   are responsible for adjudicating on the act of abortion. An
   acknowledgement of this incommensurability between the knowledge that
   the two parties hold, became the foundation for compassion. In the
   process of elucidating the use of the idiom of compassion broached in
   these parliamentary debates, the paper broadens our interpretations of
   global histories of welfare feminism in general and reproductive justice
   in particular.},

Abstract = {A central function of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement in the
   United States has been to center and express the lived experiences of
   Black people within the social and political framework of white
   supremacy. Regarding reproductive justice, BLM, as well as organizations
   like the Black Mamas Matter Alliance and Sistersong, have drawn
   political attention to the oppressive parameters existing for pregnant
   people ``birthing while Black.{''} Attention to disparities in health
   and birth outcomes for Black persons has necessary positive effects,
   such as the ability to produce data on the deleterious effects of
   anti-Blackness. However, discourses surrounding Black birthing persons
   can function to obfuscate the collective action undertaken by Black
   women and non-Black women of color. In this paper, I argue the
   hyper-focus on the problems Black pregnant/birthing persons face has at
   least four issues: (1) it encourages an ontological collapse wherein
   Black birthers are positioned as problems, rather than human beings
   facing problems; (2) obscures the collective action and care Black women
   undertake to support one another; (3) results in state solutions that
   rely on underpaid and volunteer labor of Black and non-Black women of
   color; and (4) focuses myopically on the time period of pregnancy and
   birthing for Black persons.},

Abstract = {Population size is a significant variable that can be addressed to help
   combat climate change. If global fertility rates dropped by only 0.5
   births per woman, almost a third of the emissions needed to avoid
   catastrophic climate change could be saved. This is equivalent to the
   annual emissions that would be saved from doubling the fuel efficiency
   of cars, increasing wind energy 50-fold or improving nuclear energy
   three times over. It accounts for over half of the Earth's yearly
   emissions. Yet, is there a way to address population size without
   violating human rights? To what extent should individual reproductive
   practices change? These are live questions. However, various
   philosophers claim that procreators should limit themselves to having no
   more than one child. Doing so, they say, strikes the most appropriate
   balance between protecting reproductive justice for people who want to
   have children and achieving a sustainable future.This paper pushes back
   on this claim. There are plausibly too many sexist, racist, classist and
   eugenic outcomes in demanding people limit their procreation to one
   child. Therefore, philosophers should relax their messaging about
   permissibility limits and be more concerned with helping people
   cultivate the right character to think through procreation and
   overpopulation.},

   lessons from Canada\&apos;s Muskoka Initiative},
Journal = {FEMINIST THEORY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 15},
Abstract = {Based on critical discourse analysis of Canada's Muskoka Initiative
   (2010-15), this article outlines how medicalisation contributes to the
   depoliticisation and technocratisation of global maternal health, while
   reinforcing patterns of reproductive stratification. By constructing
   maternal health as a problem of managing medicalised risk, the Muskoka
   Initiative was able to position family planning as a risk-minimising
   practice that can improve health by averting pregnancy among populations
   deemed high risk. Interpreting this construction through the lenses of
   reproductive justice and biopolitics, I argue that this construction
   contributes to reproductive stratification and exemplifies how
   medicalised discourses have replaced overt discourses of population
   control within development policy, while continuing to discourage
   reproduction among racialised women in the Global South.},

Title = {Immaterial intimacy: The neoliberal entanglement of digital technologies

Journal = {NEW MEDIA \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 14},
Abstract = {Outside of visible moments of mass mobilization, ongoing latent work,
   such as direct service and mutual aid, is a long-standing tradition in
   social movements. Yet, like all labor, personal digital devices have
   changed the norms and practices of direct service social movement work.
   In this article, as situated in the technology-media-movement complex
   (TMMC), I analyze qualitative interview data (N = 26) with volunteers
   from a yearlong ethnographic project at an abortion fund hotline in the
   reproductive justice movement in the US South. To name hotline
   volunteers' digital care labor, I offer the term immaterial intimacy to
   describe its ubiquitous, ephemeral, and intimate nature. I argue
   immaterial intimate labor enabled the organization to provide a
   responsive service, but relied on individualized digital volunteer work,
   existing within gendered and neoliberal norms. I discuss and question
   the use of personal digital technologies for direct service volunteer
   work in contemporary social movements.},

Number = {4},
Pages = {737-743},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Objective:The objective of this scoping review is to identify the
   barriers and facilitators of reproductive justice in pediatric health
   care.Introduction:Reproductive justice is defined as the right to
   maintain personal bodily autonomy, to have or not have children, and to
   parent children in safe and sustainable communities. The reproductive
   justice framework is often applied to adult women in conventional care
   settings; however, the need for health care guided by the framework
   should extend to all females of reproductive age in all care settings,
   including pediatric settings.Inclusion criteria:This review will
   consider studies from 1994 to the present that report on the barriers
   and facilitators of reproductive justice in pediatric health care.
   Studies from any setting or geographic location will be included. This
   scoping review will include pediatric patients up to 21 years of age of
   any gender identity or sexual orientation who may birth a child, and
   their health care providers.Methods:Database searches will include
   CINAHL (EBSCOhost), MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Elsevier), and Web of
   Science Core Collection. Sources of unpublished studies and gray
   literature to be searched include MedNar and ProQuest Dissertation and
   Theses Science and Engineering Collection (ProQuest). The JBI
   methodology for scoping reviews will be followed. Data extracted will
   include details about the title, authors, year of publication, type of
   evidence, participants, context, and concept. The extracted data will be
   presented in diagrammatic or tabular format in a manner that aligns with
   the objective and questions of the scoping review.Review

Abstract = {Since European settlement, the United States has controlled the
   reproduction of communities of color through tactics ranging from forced
   pregnancies, sterilizations, and abortions to immigration policies and
   policies that separate children from their families. Lesbian, gay,
   bisexual, transgender, queer (or questioning), asexual, intersex, and
   gender diverse people (LGBTQIA+) have been persecuted for sexual
   behavior and gender expression, and also restricted from having
   children. In response, women of color and LGBTQIA+ communities have
   organized for Reproductive Justice (RJ) and liberation. The Reproductive
   Justice framework, conceived in 1994 by the Women of African Descent for
   Reproductive Justice, addresses the reproductive health needs of Black
   women and communities from a broad human rights perspective. Since then,
   the framework has expanded with an intersectional approach to include
   all communities of color and LGBTQIA+ communities. Notwithstanding,
   reproductive injustice negatively impacts the health of already
   marginalized and oppressed communities, which is reflected in higher
   rates of maternal mortality, infant mortality, infertility, preterm
   births, and poorer health outcomes associated with race -based stress.
   While the impact of racial injustice on disparate health outcomes is
   increasingly addressed in family medicine, Reproductive Justice has not
   been universally incorporated into care provision or education.
   Including the RJ framework in family medicine education is critical to
   understanding how structural, economic, and political factors influence
   health outcomes to improve health care delivery from a justice and human
   rights perspective. This commentary describes how an RJ framework can
   enhance medical education and care provision, and subsequently
   identifies strategies for incorporating Reproductive Justice teaching
   into family medicine education.},

Abstract = {Assisted reproductive technology (ART), which encompasses fertility
   treatments in which eggs or embryos are handled, is a frontier of family
   law and reproductive justice, and developments in abortion jurisprudence
   may shape its borders. Abortion restrictions and other laws regulating
   pregnant people are often framed with rhetoric emphasizing fetal
   personhood or fetal rights. Now that abortion is legally unshielded from
   criminalization, the consequences of Dobbs will reach, as did
   fetal-personhood laws before, even those who are not seeking abortions.
   As commentators have observed, this collateral damage threatens to touch
   potential parents seeking to use ART. Yet so far, the most abortion
   -restrictive states tend to carve out protections for ART from their
   laws regarding fetuses. This Note argues that states touting fetal
   personhood protect ART users-while persecuting people who partake in a
   multitude of other types of conduct thought to harm fetuses-because ART
   furthers the creation of white, affluent families that suit these
   states' normative values. Fetal personhood, then, is a tool for social
   control. Advocates of reproductive freedom should surface this truth in
   efforts to stave off the proliferation of fetal-personhood laws at the
   state and federal levels.},

Abstract = {The question of control-over bodies, knowledge, narrative, and
   nation-interweaves throughout Dana Medoro's Certain Concealments: Poe,
   Hawthorne, and Early Nineteenth-Century Abortion and Stephanie Peebles
   Tavera's (P)rescription Narratives: Feminist Medical Fiction and the
   Failure of American Censorship. Medoro focuses on discourses of life and
   women's (non)reproductive sexuality in Edgar Allan Poe and Nathaniel
   Hawthorne's fiction. She establishes that the two authors were deeply
   skeptical of medicolegal definitions of life that created racial and
   economic hierarchies; through focal characters and indirect, playful
   prose, they critique discourses of life that valued some lives over
   others in the creation of Anglo-American nationalism. Tavera
   investigates late-nineteenth-century woman-authored medical fiction as
   directly engaging many of the same concepts Medoro explores.
   (P)rescription Narratives calls attention to the ways that Comstock-era
   censorship colluded with race science, medicine, and the law to limit
   women's sexual and reproductive autonomy. It demonstrates literature's
   agential capacities as the writers it addresses explicitly refute and
   redirect objectifying narratives. Combined, these texts show that
   questions of what ``counts{''} as life, and by what (and whose)
   paradigms those lives can be lived, are hardly theoretical musings.
   Rather, they determine, systemically and corporeally, ``life's
   legibility and reproduction horizontal ellipsis in the name of American
   citizenship{''} (Medoro 19). These texts, in other words, are highly
   relevant and important as literary and cultural scholarship, making a
   powerful argument for the study of the humanities. But they are also
   important because they document the subversive and agential power of the
   written word to discern, document, and possibly heal-to affect change
   for today and the future.
   La question du controle - des corps, du savoir, des recits et de la
   nation - lie entre elles les oe uvres Certain Concealments de Dana
   Medoro et (P)rescription Narratives : Feminist Medical Fiction and the
   Failure of American Censorship de Stephanie Peebles Tavera. Medoro
   s'interesse aux discours sur la vie et la sexualite (non) reproductive
   des femmes dans les fictions d'Edgar Allan Poe et de Nathaniel
   Hawthorne. L'ouvrage etablit que les deux auteurs etaient profondement
   sceptiques a l'egard des definitions medicolegales de la vie, qui
   creaient des hierarchies raciales et economiques ; a travers des
   personnages centraux et une prose indirecte et ludique, ils critiquent
   les discours sur la vie qui valorisent certaines vies plus que d'autres
   dans la formation du nationalisme anglo-americain. Tavera, dans son
   etude de la fiction medicale produite par des femmes a la fin du XIXe
   siecle, retrouve bon nombre des concepts explores par Medoro.
   (P)rescription Narratives attire l'attention sur la facon dont la
   censure de la periode Comstock s'est associee a la science des races, a
   la medecine et au droit pour limiter l'autonomie sexuelle et
   reproductive des femmes. L'ouvrage illustre les capacites agentielles de
   la litterature, dans la mesure ou les ecrivaines qu'il aborde refutent
   et reorientent explicitement les recits reifiants. Pris ensemble, ces
   deux ouvrages montrent que les questions liees a ce qui << compte >>
   comme une vie et aux paradigmes qui permettent a ces vies d'etre vecues
   (lesquels ? etablis selon quels criteres ?) ne sont pas que des
   reflexions theoriques - loin de la. Elles determinent au contraire, du
   point de vue du systeme social et du corps, << la lisibilite et la
   reproduction de la vie {[} horizontal ellipsis ] au nom de la
   citoyennete americaine >> (Medoro, p. 19 ; trad. libre). Ces textes, en
   d'autres termes, sont tres pertinents et importants du point de vue du
   savoir litteraire et culturel, et constituent un argument puissant en
   faveur de l'etude des sciences humaines. Mais leur importance tient
   egalement au fait qu'ils documentent le pouvoir subversif et agentiel de
   l'ecriture a discerner, a documenter et peut-etre a guerir - a provoquer
   le changement, aujourd'hui et pour l'avenir.},

Abstract = {Perinatal mental illness is a leading cause of death during pregnancy
   and the first postpartum year in the United States. Although better
   acute care services for mental health conditions are desperately needed,
   urgent services alone cannot create the conditions to thrive.
   Cultivating well-being requires a sustained commitment to reproductive
   justice, ``the human right to maintain personal bodily autonomy, have
   children, not have children, and parent the children we have in safe and
   sustainable communities.{''} To support reproductive justice for
   pregnant and birthing people, the Rippel Foundation's Vital Conditions
   for Health and Well-Being framework offers a holistic approach
   comprising seven domains: a thriving natural world; basic needs for
   health and safety; humane housing; meaningful work and wealth; lifelong
   learning; reliable transportation; and, central to all of these,
   belonging and civic muscle. Here we review the evidence for each of the
   vital conditions as key drivers of perinatal mental health, and we
   outline how this public health approach can advance well-being across

Abstract = {Hideo Kojima's 2019 video game Death Stranding has sold over 10 million
   copies since 2022. The game's plot features a post-apocalyptic United
   States where female bodies become commodities to produce babies, which
   the government utilizes as equipment to rebuild the country. The purpose
   of this paper is to analyze how the government's, the terrorists', and
   the player character's words and actions reinforce or reject traditional
   patriarchal views about reproduction. I first establish a background in
   post-apocalyptic narratives by synthesizing themes from The Handmaid's
   Tale, The Road, and The Walking Dead. Using feminist post-structuralism,
   I analyze how reproductive commodification is prioritized over ethics by
   the government, rejected in favor of general destruction to the greater
   good by the terrorists, and is used only when absolutely necessary by
   the player character. I finally argue that commodification narratives
   are typical within post-apocalyptic narratives, are harmful, and have

Title = {Care and the Limits of a Pro-Choice Discourse},
Journal = {HYPATIA-A JOURNAL OF FEMINIST PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 18},
Abstract = {The global pandemic exposed many flaws in the gendered political
   economy. It also illuminated how essential care is to our economy and to
   our flourishing. Yet, when care is dependent on a capitalist system that
   relies on competition, there will always be people who receive care and
   those that will not. In such a system, care is wrongly perceived to be a
   ``choice{''} one can opt into or out of. This short essay grapples with
   the discourse of care as a choice, particularly around reproductive
   decisions. Choices offered within a neoliberal market logic fail to
   understand the political relationalities of such choices. Drawing on my
   personal experience of an abortion and other examples from the first
   year of COVID-19, this essay demonstrates how little choice there is in
   matters of care; care connects and disconnects one another regardless of
   personal choices. If matters of care persist in the realm of the market
   reliant on rational economic autonomous actors, then the many
   interrelationalities of care that the pandemic exposed will not have any
   impact on attaining a more caring society. This is particularly
   important given the nature of abortion politics in the United States. I
   argue that abortion is health care, and is often the most caring
   decision a pregnant person can make for the world they are trying to
   maintain, continue, and repair (per Tronto 1993). Care is not a choice;
   it is fundamental to human society.},

Abstract = {This Article interrogates the current and future role of
   employer-sponsored health insurance in reproductive autonomy, revealing
   the impact that employers' coverage choices have on access to
   reproductive care and the legal infrastructure that prioritizes employer
   choice over individual autonomy. Over half of the population depends on
   employers for health insurance. Laws regulating employer plans give
   employers exceptionally wide latitude to decide what reproductive care
   services, if any, to cover. In their role as health care funders,
   employers pursue interests that often conflict with employees' interests
   and the aims of reproductive justice. Employers balk at covering
   services related to conceiving and bearing children, which they view as
   costly to them as both employers and insurers. While some employers'
   plans cover contraception and abortion, which may help them avoid the
   costs of pregnancy and additional dependents, many other employers
   object to covering these services. The legal infrastructure validates
   this wide spectrum of employers' choices, subordinating individuals'
   autonomy to their employers' interests. Decoupling health care access
   from employment is thus necessary to bolster reproductive justice. But
   the most effective means of decoupling-a public option and single-payer
   public benefits-raise tough questions about reproductive exceptionalism.
   Shifting the third-party payment role from employers to governments does
   not truly remove the threat to reproductive justice, so progressive
   health reform risks sacrificing reproductive justice to the cause of
   universal benefits. This Article illuminates how vigilantly centering
   reproductive justice in single -payer reform proposals can make those
   reforms more feasible and durable.},

Abstract = {Abortion was decriminalised in Northern Ireland in October 2019.
   Following decriminalisation, the new regulations set out legal provision
   for abortion up until 12 weeks, with conditions thereafter. This
   cross-sectional descriptive survey, conducted in late 2019 in Northern
   Ireland, gathered the views of health professionals on
   decriminalisation, and their willingness to provide abortion services.
   This article provides a thematic analysis of answers to narrative
   questions from the online survey, and identifies priority areas of
   engagement with healthcare professionals. We assess how healthcare
   professional roles and responsibilities, abortion procedures, the
   foetus, and women and pregnant people were discursively constructed by
   respondents who are willing or unwilling to provide abortion services in
   Northern Ireland. We identify a narrow understanding of `harm', and
   gendered norms of women as irresponsible or duplicitous, as inhibitory
   factors to the normalisation of abortion services in Northern Ireland.},

Title = {Perspectives of Certified Nurse-Midwives and Physicians on the
   Structural and Institutional Barriers that Contribute to the
   Reproductive Inequities of Black Birthing People in the San Francisco
   Bay Area},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MIDWIFERY \& WOMENS HEALTH},

Abstract = {IntroductionBlack birthing people in the United States
   disproportionately endure inequitable experiences and outcomes during
   pregnancy and childbirth via structural, interpersonal, and obstetric
   racism. In this study, the researchers explore provider perspectives of
   how racism is perpetuated in institutional perinatal and reproductive
   health care.MethodsCritical Race Theory, Reproductive Justice, and
   midwifery theory were operationalized through secondary thematic
   analysis of existing qualitative data from the Community Racial Equity
   and Training Interventions and Evaluation of Current and Future
   Healthcare Clinicians Study. Twenty-four perinatal providers (certified
   nurse-midwives {[}n = 7] and physicians {[}n = 17]) voluntarily
   participated in interviews. A comparative approach was used to determine
   how professional identity and model of care influence physicians' and
   certified nurse-midwives' perceptions of equity.ResultsThematic analysis
   produced 5 themes: racism as a comorbidity, health care systems'
   inability to address the needs of Black birthing people, health care
   systems prioritizing providers over patients are failed systems,
   patients are the experts in the optimal health care model, and benefits
   of interprofessional teams grounded in Reproductive Justice.
   Additionally, both physicians and midwives expressed a need for a new
   care model.DiscussionWith these findings, our team proposes a
   modification of the midwifery model for application by all provider
   types that could radically shift the experience and outcomes of
   perinatal and reproductive health care and reduce mortality. Using a
   human rights approach to care, a Reproductive Justice-Public Health
   Critical Race praxis-informed midwifery model may be operationalized by
   all perinatal and reproductive health care providers. This novel model
   reflects an iterative process that may offer institutions and providers
   methods to build on past research supporting midwifery-centered care for
   improving outcomes for all patients by specifically focusing on
   improving care of Black birthing people. The implications of this work
   offer broad application in current clinical practice, quality
   improvement, research, technology, and patient resources.},

Title = {`They all of a sudden became new people': Using reproductive justice to
   explore narratives of hormonal contraceptive experience in Sweden},

Abstract = {This study explores how Swedish women narrate experiences of hormonal
   contraceptives through utilizing the frameworks of biomedicalization and
   reproductive justice, adding a social justice perspective previously
   lacking. Ten in-depth interviews were conducted with women who had
   experience of using hormonal contraception. Political narrative analysis
   illuminated how these women moved narratively both chronologically, from
   the teenage years to adulthood, and through social positioning, in their
   contraceptive stories. Two different, often conflicting, discourses of
   hormonal contraceptives emerged, which the women constantly negotiated.
   These can be described as (1) a biomedical interpretative prerogative,
   promoting hormonal methods as an easy fit for everyone, and negating the
   diverse lived experiences of women, and (2) a simplified critical media
   and online discourse, painting hormonal methods as an enemy to female
   health. From a reproductive justice standpoint, these stories illuminate
   that age is a relevant intersectional location, and even privileged
   women in a country known for its `gender equality agenda' can experience
   subtle yet very real, reproductive coercion, when agency becomes
   constrained to choosing hormonal contraceptives within a dominant
   biomedical script. Even though critique of the mechanistic prescription
   of hormonal contraception is rather ubiquitous, the opposition in these
   narratives does not take the form of rejection of biomedical knowledge,
   rather the biomedical paradigm is internalized and incorporated into the
   embodied knowledge. This study shows that upstream factors such as
   gendered social injustices, reproductive norms, and a biomedical
   expansion are intricately interwoven with embodied experience of
   hormonal contraceptive use. It is important to acknowledge that distinct
   lived experiences of mood or personality change in women using hormonal
   contraceptives are contextual and dependent on intersectional location.
   I propose no simple panacea, but when a state-sanctioned biomedical
   prerogative puts all emphasis on individual reproductive planning
   behaviour, it obscures structural inequalities and narrows imaginable
   life trajectories.},

Title = {Menarche and reproductive health in Spanish Roma women from a
   reproductive justice perspective: a qualitative study},
Journal = {REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 2},
Abstract = {ObjectivesThis study aimed to explore the perceptions of Roma women
   about their experience of menarche and reproductive health considering
   the principles of reproductive justice.DesignQualitative study based on
   semi-structured interviews with Roma women ages 18 through 67 in
   different neighborhoods in the southeast of Spain. Using a thematic
   analysis, we analyzed experiences related to menarche and menstruation
   and their significance for reproductive health, the preparation for the
   phase of menarche and intergenerational support.ResultsThe Roma women
   interviewed shared their approach to the experiences of menarche and
   menstruation as children in their family environments with a focus on
   access to information provided by other women in the family and
   community for reproductive health management. In their discourses we
   observed that the onset of menstruation supposes a rupture in the public
   and private spaces of girls and women.ConclusionsThe results of this
   study suggest that women and girls do not gain access to information
   that contributes to their reproductive wellbeing through their
   experience of menarche. Access to resources and skills to manage
   biological changes in adolescents could contribute to reducing the
   impact of cultural myths, false ideas and taboos that prevent advocacy
   and empowerment on issues of reproductive justice.
   This study shows that the public spaces surrounding Roma women do not
   provide the tools and resources to promote and maintain their wellbeing
   and reproductive health after the onset of this important time. Sexual
   and reproductive health is not addressed during the time of childhood
   nor adolescence. Roma women lack a framework with an established
   discourse on reproductive justice, along with the necessary
   institutional resources. Preparation for and follow-up of the onset of
   menstruation among Roma women could be a key for their health. These
   results coincide with qualitative studies carried out in women from
   different cultural origins, in which menarche and menstruation are
   experienced as a transcendental fact. In other contexts, similar to Roma
   women, this stage in women's health lacks resources and information and
   an adequate approach from the perspective of reproductive health, which
   conditions the menstrual, sexual and reproductive health of women across
   their lifespan. Roma women experience menarche as a significant change
   in the life of a woman. They describe having lived the process as an
   abandonment of childhood and the beginning of an adult life, one that is
   implicitly linked to maternity and couple relationships. The results
   show that they defend the continuity of childhood among the new
   generation. Roma women express that they experienced menarche as an
   event that was traumatic, embarrassing and confusing. Menarche and
   menstruation are attended to in private and among the family, and
   masculine figures do not participate. The mother is the only transmitter
   of information and support during the process.},

Abstract = {<bold>Purpose:</bold> Inaccurate beliefs about medication abortion (MA)
   are common. This study evaluated pilot data from a community-led media
   intervention designed to increase MA knowledge among Black and Latinx
   women in Georgia. <bold>Methods:</bold> Participants (N=855) viewed the
   intervention video and completed pre-post surveys. Data were analyzed
   using linear and logistic regression. <bold>Results:</bold> Knowledge
   scores significantly increased from 3.88/5.00 to 4.47/5.00. Participants
   who were Native American, Asian and Pacific Islander, multiracial,
   Black, <20 years old, and living in Georgia scored below the sample mean
   at baseline; however, nearly all disparities disappeared after
   intervention exposure. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> This intervention
   effectively increased MA knowledge and narrowed racial/ethnic,
   age-based, and geographic disparities.},

Abstract = {This study examines Reproductive Justice (RJ) for Black women in
   Cincinnati. While recognizing the importance of ensuring safe, legal,
   and affordable abortion access, RJ extends beyond this narrow focus and
   delves into the complex intersections of race, gender, sexuality, and
   social class. Employing principles from Black feminist praxis in
   utilizing Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) methods, we
   conducted qualitative interviews to center the voices and experiences of
   24 self-identified Black women. The research uncovers three main themes:
   1) Ideological violence against Black women, with subthemes: beauty and
   body image, strength and resilience, and stigmatized mothering; 2)
   Distrust in daycare services; and 3) Hurdles for low income women in
   accessing abortion care. These findings shed light on a post-Roe
   reproductive justice landscape for Black women in Cincinnati.},

Abstract = {The overturn of Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey in June 2022
   solidified the patchwork nature of abortion access in the United States
   and clarified, for some, the need to move beyond a framework of
   reproductive rights toward an approach to reproductive justice that
   would guarantee medical autonomy for individuals in the pursuit of (not)
   becoming parents. We present the dissent in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's
   Health Organization as an attempt to create a legally intelligible
   reproductive justice. We analyze the excesses of the dissent-the
   violations of generic and institutional norms concerning, specifically,
   the inclusion of the lived experiences of pregnant people. We conclude,
   however, that the capacity for rhetorical invention in the dissent is
   muted by the uncritical (re)circulation of neoliberal tropes endemic to
   the Supreme Court and the broader abortion debate in the United States.
   We conclude with the implications for this (imperfect) articulation of
   reproductive justice in an institutional context.},

Abstract = {Laws structure people's ``lived citizenships.{''} This article considers
   the ways in which Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization gave
   states the power to regulate reproduction in ways that have
   disproportionate consequences for pregnant people with disabilities.
   Specifically, Dobbs did not eliminate the right to bodily integrity, but
   rather put conditions on who can claim a right to bodily integrity in
   federal courts. Moreover, uneven changes to Medicaid financing of
   abortions have created a ``postcode lottery.{''} People's ability to
   receive care is determined by a politics of place - or even individual
   providers. These policies create structural inequalities.},

Abstract = {IntroductionFrom 2013 to 2019, Black women comprised 73\% of
   pregnancy-related deaths in Philadelphia. There is currently a dearth of
   research on the continuity of midwifery care from initiation of prenatal
   care through birth in relation to characteristics such as race/ethnicity
   and income. The aim of this study was to investigate whether
   race/ethnicity and insurance status were associated with the likelihood
   of a pregnant person who begins prenatal care with a midwife to remain
   in midwifery care for birth attendance.MethodsThis was a retrospective
   cohort study of a diverse population of pregnant patients who gave birth
   in a large tertiary care hospital and had their first prenatal visit
   with a certified nurse-midwife (CNM) between June 2, 2009, and June 30,
   2020 (n = 5121). We used multivariable, log-binomial regression models
   to calculate risk ratios of transferring to physician care (vs remaining
   within CNM care), adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, prepregnancy body
   mass index, insurance type, and comorbidities.ResultsAfter adjusting for
   pregnancy-related risk factors, non-Hispanic Black patients (adjusted
   relative risk {[}aRR], 1.14; 95\% CI, 1.04-1.24) and publicly insured
   patients (aRR, 1.11; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.22) were at higher risk of being
   transferred to physician care compared with non-Hispanic White and
   privately insured patients. Secondary analysis revealed that
   non-Hispanic Black patients had higher risk of transferring and having
   an operative birth (aRR, 1.35; 95\% CI, 1.18-1.55), whereas publicly
   insured patients were at higher risk of being transferred for reasons
   other than operative births (aRR, 1.35; 95\% CI,
   1.18-1.54).DiscussionThese findings indicate that Black and publicly
   insured patients were more likely than White and privately insured
   patients to transfer to physician care even after adjustment for
   comorbid conditions. Thus, further research is needed to identify the
   factors that contribute to racial and economic disparity in continuity
   of midwifery care.},

   Knowledge?},
Journal = {MERIDIANS-FEMINISM RACE TRANSNATIONALISM},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1, SI},
Abstract = {In the quest to create global maternal health care protocols, African
   Indigenous birthing epistemologies are often overlooked in research,
   policy, and advocacy aiming to improve maternal health and reduce the
   maternal mortality ratio (MMR). The global maternal health strategy, the
   Safe Motherhood Initiative (SMI), excludes Indigenous birthing knowledge
   by requiring all childbirth to be attended by only birth attendants
   trained in the Western medical paradigm. This forms the bedrock of the
   assumed authoritative expertise of the Western medical birthing
   approach. Despite the campaign for sole reliance on SMI, Africa's MMR
   remains the highest compared to other regions. Nigeria, Africa's most
   populous country, also has the third-highest MMR in the world as of
   2020. This failure of SMI to reduce MMR for Nigeria and Africa more
   broadly calls for the inclusion of marginalized Indigenous birthing
   knowledge for its epistemological and practical significance. Using
   Nigeria as a case study, with a transnational connection with the United
   States, the article argues that excluding African birthing knowledge and
   methods in SMI promotes epistemic and obstetric violence. Adopting the
   reproductive justice framework as a decolonial tool, the article asserts
   that African Indigenous birthing knowledge is simultaneously valid and
   valuable for holistic approaches to maternal health.},

Title = {Health care itineraries for women in situations of abortion:
   methodological aspects of a qualitative study for <i>Birth in Brazil

Abstract = {In recent decades, several academic studies on abortion have been
   produced in Brazil, with different designs, objectives, and
   methodologies. However, due to the diversity of situations in which
   Brazilian women experience abortion, the complexity of this topic, and
   its modulations in different political and sociocultural contexts, it
   still challenges academicians and the fields of health and reproductive
   rights. In this article, we present methodological aspects of a
   qualitative study on health care itineraries of women in situations of
   abortion, a component of the Birth in Brazil II survey, whose objective
   is to discuss the effects of gender; race/ethnicity; social class;
   generational, regional, and territorial inequalities on care
   itineraries. We discuss the study design development, the construction
   of the theoretical framework and specific analytical axes, the
   development of interview instrument, definition of participant selection
   criteria, strategies to contact participants and conduct the interviews,
   management of field work and materials produced, analytical procedures,
   and ethical issues. In total, 120 narrative interviews were conducted in
   order to include a diversity of women and obtain detailed results from
   the quantitative analysis under Birth in Brazil II survey. The context
   of criminalization of abortion has an impact on the production of
   knowledge on this subject, creating challenges such as difficult access
   to women, women's anonymity, privacy and data confidentiality, creation
   of objective and subjective conditions so that they can narrate their
   experiences in depth. With this article, we seek to contribute to the
   debate about these challenges in abortion research in Brazil.},

Volume = {108},

Pages = {2493-2560},
Abstract = {The American system of rights is individualized-premised on the concept
   of singular, physically separate, and autonomous people. The rise of the
   fetal personhood movement complicates this basic understanding. If
   rights attach to singular, autonomous people, and fetuses are legally
   people, then the body of a pregnant person becomes conceptually
   unintelligible as it contains potentially two, interrelated people. Such
   a circumstance is fundamentally a contradiction within a framework that
   insists that rights attach to people who are, by definition, singular,
   separate, and autonomous. This Article argues that, as a result of this
   apparent contradiction, fetal personhood laws make the humanity of the
   pregnant person precarious. If the law has no framework for two rights
   holders in one body, then the pregnant person must be something else
   entirely. She becomes less of a subject and more of an object- a
   reproductive vessel, merely the container for another individual
   rights-holder. Reproductive justice scholars and advocates have long
   argued that laws purporting to endow the fetus with person- hood
   exacerbate the ``maternal-fetal conflict{''} and undermine pregnant
   people's rights. This Article argues, relying on both decades of
   feminist legal theory and original empirical evidence, that granting
   full personhood to a fetus has an even more insidious
   outcome-undermining the legal personhood of women entirely and
   recategorizing them in the eyes of the law as non-person ob- jects.
   Looking across cultures and eras, it is unfortunately not dif- ficult to
   ascertain what might happen when human beings are treated as objects.
   Such objectification results in almost certain abuse, sometimes of the
   most horrifying variety.},

Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The gauge of a society is how it responds to women and
   children and, in settler colonial nations, how it responds to the
   Indigenous women and children. This includes how society upholds the
   rights and responsibilities of women's self-determination of body rights
   and reproductive Justice. Reproductive justice in the settler colonial
   environment of Aotearoa (1) is tightly tied to the experiences of wahine
   Maori (2) and our lived realities across the colonial project. To give
   full rights and responsibilities to wahine as holders of whakapapa,
   birthing practices, and keepers of knowledge, we must be willing to
   assess and critique society and hold colonial systems to account.
   APPROACH: This article follows on from the companion literature analysis
   article ``He Whare Takata: Wahine Maori reproductive justice in the
   child protection system{''}, which provides a detailed description of
   pre- and post -colonial her story, providing the reader with an
   extensive storying of wahine as leaders. Both articles accept a mana( 3)
   wahine foundational position that asserts the rakatirataka (leadership
   and self-determination) of wahine and the inherent rights of wahine as `
   he whare takata (4) `, the house of humanity. CONCLUSIONS: Drawing on
   the groundwork laid in the companion article, this analysis examines the
   Oranga Tamariki (5 )(OT) practice and evidence centres, specifically
   auditing content produced following the ``Hawkes Bay Uplift{''}( 6) for
   evidence of a shift of practice that incorporates wahine knowing, being
   and doing holding to the foundation of ` he whare takata `.},

Journal = {PEDIATRICS IN REVIEW},

Pages = {3-13},

Abstract = {Several effective contraceptive options are available for use by
   adolescents, including the long-acting reversible subdermal implant and
   intrauterine devices, which provide a high level of convenience,
   privacy, and effectiveness for an adolescent. Knowledge of all the
   effective birth control methods is essential for the pediatrician to be
   able to provide effective contraceptive counseling for an adolescent. An
   approach to counseling using a reproductive justice framework, which
   allows the provider and adolescent patient to engage in shared
   decision-making, is described. This article focuses on the long-acting
   reversible etonogestrel (ENG) subdermal implant for adolescents. The ENG
   implant is labeled for preventing pregnancy by suppressing ovulation.
   The ENG implant may also have a role in ameliorating dysmenorrhea and
   heavy menstrual bleeding. Postlabeling studies indicate that the ENG
   implant is effective for up to 5 years, although the device's labeling
   states effectivenessup to 3 years. The main contraindication to using
   the ENG implant is pregnancy itself. Safe initiation of the ENG implant
   is described, including an approach to determine whether an adolescent
   is pregnant. The main adverse effect of the ENG implant is an
   unpredictable bleeding pattern that is most often ameliorated by use of
   nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, as well as estrogen, if not
   contraindicated for the patient. Details of the insertion and removal
   procedures, including potential complications, are described to enable
   the pediatrician to provide effective anticipatory guidance for the
   adolescent.},

Abstract = {Inadequate menstrual health education is a global public health issue.
   An innovative Global Classroom course, Teaching Menstrual Health:
   Dispelling Myths and Misconceptions, is situated at the intersection of
   gender, culture, and health. The course engages students from India and
   the U.S. in project-based learning on menstrual health and
   misconceptions that impact individuals and communities. Linking the
   fields of public health and education, students engage in lectures and
   discussions that address power imbalances and build cultural competency
   before working collaboratively on projects to address stigma around
   menstruation. The course was designed to address colonial narratives
   that marginalize menstruators and undermine women's health. Student
   experiences are quoted to demonstrate how the five course development
   strategies create action for menstrual and reproductive justice.},

Title = {``The thing in my arm{''}: Providing contraceptive services for
   adolescents in primary care},
Journal = {WOMENS HEALTH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {20},
Abstract = {Background: Due to high rates of unintended pregnancies in Delaware, the
   state launched a public health initiative in 2014 to increase access to
   contraceptive services.Objectives: This study was designed to assess the
   practice-level barriers and facilitators to providing contraceptive
   care, particularly long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs), to
   adolescents in primary care settings.Design: This qualitative study was
   part of a larger process evaluation of the Delaware Contraceptive Access
   Now (DelCAN) initiative.Methods: In-depth, semi-structured qualitative
   interviews were conducted with 16 practice administrators at 13
   adolescent-serving primary care sites across the state of Delaware. A
   process of open, axial, and selective coding was used to analyze the
   data.Results: Despite the interest in LARC among their adolescent
   patients, administrators described numerous barriers to providing LARC
   for adolescents including confidentiality in patient visits and billing,
   preceptorship, and provider discomfort and assumptions about the need
   for contraception among adolescent patients.Conclusion: Findings from
   this study reveal substantial barriers to providing contraception to
   adolescents, even in primary care practices that were committed to
   comprehensive contraceptive access for their adolescent patients. This
   study supports the need for contraceptive care to be integrated into
   training of pediatricians at every stage of their education. Such
   training must go beyond education about contraceptive options and the
   clinical skills necessary for LARC insertion and removal, to include
   counseling skills based in a reproductive justice framework. Additional
   changes in policies and practices for adolescent patients would further
   increase access to contraceptive care.},

   responses to Rawls, social epistemology, and Black feminist critique.
   All overlook the sustained analysis of space, race, and waste, which
   this article argues is its most valuable contribution for critical
   philosophy of race today. This article claims that that in addition to
   ``cognitive resistance,{''} an analysis of Black trash suggests intimate
   ecological resistance as a fundamental aspect of the political
   self-assertion of racialized ``subpersons,{''} and argues that this
   challenges any qualified fidelity to the basic tenets of liberal
   political philosophy. Focusing on waste from the pig industry in North
   Carolina, the article returns to Mills's essay ``Black Trash{''} to
   demonstrate the importance of ecology to the racial contract and its
   renewed relevance. Building on Shatema Threadcraft's critical engagement
   with Mills in Intimate Justice, the article concludes that a Black trash
   feminist approach that foregrounds intimate matters is necessary for
   ecological resistance.},

Title = {Reparations for Reproductive Slavery and Its Afterlives},
Journal = {CRITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF RACE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Contemporary US discourse on reparations tends to focus on the
   suppression of Black economic interests, but the harms of slavery are
   not exhausted by the labor expropriation of slaves and its concomitant
   wealth accumulation for white people and the United States at large.
   Reproductive oppression was constitutive of the institution of slavery,
   and its harms continue to reverberate today. This article thus calls for
   reproductive reparations, , or the transparent and sustained attention
   to the effects of racialized reproductive oppression as they intersect
   with calls for reparations for slavery. Reconceiving reparations through
   histories and presents of reproductive harm is required to more fully
   account for the wrongs of slavery and provide a broader reach for
   radical societal transformation in our present.},

Title = {Reproductive justice in Uruguay Maternal and Perinatal Outcomes in the

Journal = {REVISTA MEDICA DEL URUGUAY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {40},

Abstract = {Introduction: Reproductive justice is the ability of dividuals and
   societies to realize sexual and reproductive rights. On the contrary,
   reproductive injustice (RI) exposes the presence of risks to the
   developmental process during pregnancy and early childhood. Objective:
   To describe the evolution of a set of indicators related to reproductive
   justice in the Integrated National Health System (SNIS) of Uruguay over
   last 12 years and compare trends between the public and private
   subsectors. Methodology: A descriptive, retrospective study of set of
   indicators included in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and
   national health objectives was conducted. Maternal mortality ratio
   (MMR), incidence of preterm birth (PTB), low birth weight (LBW),
   congenital syphilis (CS) were analyzed in the public and private
   subsectors of the SNIS over the past years. Results: During the analyzed
   period the maternal mortality ratio has always been higher in the public
   subsector, except in the year 2015. The incidence of preterm birth
   during the period has ranged between 8.6\% and 10\%. It is higher in the
   public subsector, except some periods where it is higher in the private
   subsector. The incidence of low birth weight is always higher the public
   subsector, with its highest incidence in 2022 at 9.3. Congenital
   syphilis has always been higher the public subsector, ranging from 1.3
   to 7.1, while in the private subsector, the values range from 0.2 to
   0.6. Conclusions: The difference in these perinatal health indicators
   between the two healthcare subsectors in our country reflects that
   despite having an Integrated National Health System, there is a
   disparity that impacts the results of final and intermediate indicators,
   thus determining the existence of reproductive injustice.},

Abstract = {Privileged (in various forms, but especially class) people use egg or
   sperm donation and take other reproductive measures to achieve
   parenthood at all costs. Infertility issues for heterosexual partners
   and those who use donor eggs and sperm outside of heteronormative
   relationships has evolved into a type of entitled desperation and
   racial/ethnic/able-bodied form of eugenics, both further complicated by
   the cultural milieu of the post-Dobbs decision era. To illustrate how
   these rhetorics of infertility operate within broader neoliberal and
   racialized discourses, we critically consider three themes: first, we
   contend that fertility issues should become theorized through
   reproductive justice theory, particularly as class/race/nation divides
   donors from recipients, through forms of capitalistic endeavor as a
   rational enterprise; second, we review how ``infertility{''} has become
   rhetorically important in the U.S. cultural milieu in critical
   communication and cultural studies; and finally, we argue that donor
   rhetorics represent a form of neoliberalism situated within
   racial/ethnic able-bodied eugenics and an inability to conceive, which
   results in emotional, physical, and financial cost to the self and
   society.},

Title = {Conceptual anatomy of the female genitalia using text mining and
   implications for patient care},
Journal = {MEDICAL HUMANITIES},

Abstract = {This article analyses the conceptual histories of words associated with
   female genital parts to explore how they may affect the lived experience
   of people with these parts and the quality of gynaecological care they
   receive. Specifically, we examine the implications of using the word
   `vagina' to replace the word `vulva', or indeed to indicate the entire
   female genitalia. This article does so through an analysis of existing
   scholarly work and through text mining methods such as word frequencies,
   most distinctive word collocates and word-embeddings drawn from literary
   and women's magazine corpora. We find that words indicating specific
   female genital parts are very infrequently mentioned in our corpora,
   which shows that there is a troubling lack of exposure and education in
   our socio-cultural context when it comes to the female genital anatomy.
   When they are mentioned, their usage reflects historical and patriarchal
   associations that have been primarily attached to the word `vagina'.
   When it comes to the `vagina' and `vulva', the penis is the most
   prevalent association by far; whereas the most commonly occurring female
   genital parts are parts to do with reproduction-reinforcing a
   long-standing and disproportionate emphasis on the female genitalia's
   reproductive function. Our research also reveals a concerning emphasis
   on non-evidence-based female hygiene products, thus perpetuating the
   damaging stereotype of the dirty vagina. These findings may explain many
   negative patient outcomes such as stigma attached to seeking out timely
   gynaecological care, lack of informed medical consent and
   non-evidence-based practices exacerbated by problematic cultural
   depictions of the female genitalia. They can also explain the neglect of
   female sexual agency, pleasure and well-being. Understanding historical
   and contemporary usages of words for the female genitalia has important
   implications for the quality of patient care today and is a critical
   component of gender and reproductive justice.},

Abstract = {During the 1970s, Planned Parenthood (PP) went from an established,
   well-funded birth control provider in the political mainstream to a
   controversial organization associated with abortion. As abortion rights
   mobilized both feminists and a conservative opposition, the agenda and
   rhetoric of PP had to expand and adjust accordingly. This project
   explores the ways PP's mission and the political terrain in which it
   operated became more complicated in this decade, focusing on the
   strategies it adopted to survive. There is much to be learned from how
   the organization sought to weather the unique tensions experienced by
   the legalization of abortion, the energy of the women's movement, and
   the emerging backlash against perceived liberal excesses as it navigated
   the often oppositional demands of being both a service provider and
   advocate. As abortion access enters a new era of vulnerability and
   contestation, the role of PP remains uncertain. In exploring a key
   moment in the organization's past, we also ponder the role of PP in the
   Dobbs era and whether it has either the capacity or political will to
   serve its constituents given its complicated history and still
   complicated present.},

Abstract = {In post-Roe America, access to reproductive care is rapidly dwindling,
   with the criminalization of abortion on the rise. Yet, in these
   frustrating and perilous times, organizations, activists, and volunteers
   facilitate access to care every day via digital direct service activism.
   This article is a meditation on the transformational nature of direct
   service praxis in the contemporary reproductive justice movement. To
   document my own ongoing transformation, I include autoethnographic
   reflections on my experiences as a direct service volunteer from August
   2021 to December 2022. Practices such as distributing abortion funding
   and peer counseling on an anonymous talkline have transformed my
   understanding and experience of liberation work. I want to draw
   attention to these quiet actions and exchanges that often go unnoticed
   in our loud, neoliberal capitalist context. These communions of care and
   connection help forge the future now, in small, radical, and tangible
   ways.},

Title = {Renewed calls for abortion-related research in the post-Roe era},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {DEC 18},
Abstract = {Nearly 50 years after Roe versus Wade, the United States Supreme Court's
   decision in Dobbs versus Jackson Women's Health Organization unraveled
   the constitutional right to abortion, allowing individual states to
   severely restrict or ban the procedure. In response, leading medical,
   public health, and community organizations have renewed calls for
   research to elucidate and address the burgeoning social and medical
   consequences of new abortion restrictions. Abortion research not only
   includes studies that establish the safety, quality, and efficacy of
   evidence-based abortion care protocols, but also encompasses studies on
   the availability of abortion care, the consequences of being denied an
   abortion, and the legal and social burdens surrounding abortion. The
   urgency of these calls for new evidence underscores the importance of
   ensuring that research in this area is conducted in an ethical and
   respectful manner, cognizant of the social, political, and structural
   conditions that shape reproductive health inequities and impact each
   stage of research-from protocol design to dissemination of findings.
   Research ethics relates to the moral principles undergirding the design
   and execution of research projects, and concerns itself with the
   technicalities of ethical questions related to the research process,
   such as informed consent, power relations, and confidentiality. Critical
   insights and reflections from reproductive justice, community
   engagement, and applied ethics frameworks have bolstered existing
   research ethics scholarship and discourse by underscoring the importance
   of meaningful engagement with community stakeholders-bringing attention
   to overlapping structures of oppression, including racism, sexism, and
   ways that these structures are perpetuated in the research process.},

Abstract = {This conceptual article highlights the intersections of the historical
   and current status of reproductive violence and environmental injustices
   in the United States. Environmental injustices intersect with
   individuals' ability to determine whether and when to have children and
   how to parent in safe and sustainable communities, affirming their
   culture. Current trends exacerbate racial, ethnic, and cultural
   disparities. The Grand Challenges of Social Work mandates the profession
   to identify new perspectives and opportunities for change. Reproductive
   justice and environmental justice offer comprehensive human rights and
   justice-based frameworks that edify systemic oppression and call for
   equitable solutions. Social work practice, research, and education can
   benefit from following reproductive justice and environmental justice
   frameworks recommended to identify opportunities and solutions.
   Opportunities for social work are outlined at the micro, mezzo, and
   macro levels.},

Abstract = {This article explores the ethical implications of mandatory parental
   consent requirements for adolescents seeking sexual and reproductive
   health services (SRHS). Using a Reproductive Justice framework, which
   identifies systemic barriers to accessing healthcare services, we
   examine ageism as a potential factor restricting adolescents' access to
   SRHS. While the Reproductive Justice framework has addressed systemic
   issues like racism and ableism in healthcare, ageism involving
   adolescents has been less explored. The article challenges the
   pertinence of mandatory parental consent requirements-as a potential
   barrier-for adolescents' access to SRHS. We argue that in the specific
   context of SRHS (contraceptives, abortion, testing and treatment of
   sexually transmitted infections), adolescents' autonomy
   (self-determination) should be respected if they request to access those
   services independently. From a global health perspective, adolescents
   have a low prevalence and uneven access to SRHS. To address the issue,
   we propose the integration of adolescence into the Reproductive Justice
   movement to empower them through education on how to access the SRHS
   they need.},

Title = {Abortion access in the Americas: a hemispheric and historical approach},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {DEC 6},
Abstract = {This perspective article situates the 2022 United States (U.S.) Supreme
   Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade (1973) within the broader history of
   abortion rights activism and legislation in the greater Americas. The
   U.S. public has stereotyped Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) as
   socially conservative regarding gender issues and anti-reproductive
   rights. But twenty-first-century LAC presents a more complicated
   landscape than this dominant narrative suggests. In the past 15 years,
   political, legislative, and public health advances and setbacks across
   the region provide both a blueprint for re-establishing access to safe
   and legal abortion and a warning on the consequences of the
   criminalization of abortion for the U.S. Employing a narrative approach
   that summarizes recent interdisciplinary literature, this perspective
   traces the history of the expansion of abortion access in the Americas.
   Mexico (2007, 2023), Uruguay (2012), Argentina (2020), and Colombia
   (2022) legalized abortion on demand within specific timeframes. These
   expansions coexist with severe restrictions on abortion in various
   nations including Haiti (1835), the Dominican Republic (1884, 2009),
   Honduras (1985, 2021), El Salvador (1997), and Nicaragua (2006), as well
   as some states in the United States (2022). This perspective finds that
   legalization occurs when feminist activists eschew U.S.-based feminist
   rhetoric of individual rights and choice to reframe abortion as a form
   of gender-based violence within a discourse of health and wellbeing as a
   human right. According to this perspective, restrictions on access to
   the procedure constitute a form of violence against women and people
   capable of bearing children and violate human rights.},

Abstract = {This article presents an in-depth analysis of abortion access and rights
   within the Reproductive Justice framework, underscoring the health,
   social, and economic consequences of limited access. It emphasizes the
   critical role of abortion as essential, safe health care and highlights
   the complexities surrounding abortion decisions and the barriers faced
   by poor and historically marginalized populations. Amid the escalating
   access restrictions, the article concludes with a call to action for
   obstetricians and gynecologists and our allied health care providers to
   recognize, support, and advocate for safe, legal, and affordable
   abortion services as fundamental to health care equity and human rights.},

Title = {Small Family, Happy Family? Fertility Preferences and the

Journal = {POPULATION RESEARCH AND POLICY REVIEW},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {To design family planning policies in Sub-Saharan Africa that are based
   on reproductive empowerment instead of reproductive control, knowledge
   on fertility preferences and trade-offs between the number of children
   and child-raising quality is key. This study is the first to empirically
   investigate fertility decisions and the quantity-quality trade-off
   theory from a preferences perspective. For this purpose, we use a novel
   discrete choice experimental method, including three quality and one
   quantity aspect of child-raising, and three socio-economic drivers of
   fertility. The choice experiment was executed with 1000 men and women in
   rural Senegal and rural Uganda. We show that rural households prefer to
   have many children, but women and non-poor respondents demonstrate a
   lower preference for many children than men and poor respondents. We
   find that the quantity-quality trade-off is a two-sided story. On the
   one hand, for most of the quality attributes, we confirm the existence
   of a trade-off. On the other hand, quantity and quality are
   complementary when all children in the household can attain a lower
   secondary school diploma. Our results imply that improving living
   conditions and access to infrastructure in rural areas may empower
   people to make decisions leading to a lower fertility. Aligning family
   planning programs with reproductive justice requires a shift in focus
   from reproductive control, based on mere expansion of contraceptive use,
   to reproductive empowerment, based on preference-based family planning
   programs. Improving rural livelihoods in general, and specific targeting
   of family planning programs to people with low-fertility preferences
   could be a first step.},

Abstract = {Objectives: This study aimed to estimate the annual number of
   incarcerated pregnant people in state and federal prisons needing an
   abortion. Study design: We used 2021 Bureau of Justice Statistics data
   and prior studies' findings to estimate the number of pregnant
   incarcerated people, then calculated state-specific abortion ratios to
   determine the number potentially needing an abortion. Results: Of 638
   pregnant people incarcerated in prisons annually, 110 would be expected
   to need an abortion, including 55 in states where abortion is currently
   banned or restricted. Conclusions: Under Dobbs, many incarcerated
   pregnant people will be forced to continue unwanted pregnancies to term.

Title = {Reproductive care in community health centers: Multi-method evaluation
   of the Illinois Contraceptive Access Now (ICAN!) demonstration
   program☆☆,☆},
Journal = {CONTRACEPTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {129},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Objectives: Nearly one-third of low-income women of reproductive age in
   the U.S. receive care in federally qualified community health centers,
   but comprehensive reproductive care is not consistently provided.
   Illinois Contraceptive Access Now (ICAN!) is an initiative addressing
   the access gap to high-quality contraceptive care with a focus on
   normalizing reproductive health screening for patients in federally
   qualified community health centers (FQHCs). Study design: This
   multi-method program evaluation used the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption,
   Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework, with retrospective and
   prospective data collection from three Illinois FQHCs who participated
   as Quality Hubs, and from a Community Advisory Board. We conducted
   descriptive analysis of patient surveys using the Person-Centered
   Contraceptive Counseling (PCCC) measure (n = 142); clinician and staff
   pre-and post-training surveys (n = 210); and Community Advisory Board
   surveys (n = 8) collecting quantitative and qualitative feedback. We ran
   logistic regression on claims data from 15- to 49-year-old patients
   identified as female at birth (n = 103,756). Results: Reach assessment
   showed patients receiving contraceptive or preconception care increased
   from 1063 per month in 2020 to 1236 per month in 2021 (16\% increase),
   while general volume increased 2\%. Effectiveness showed most patients
   (78\%) described the quality of contraceptive counseling as
   ``excellent{''} on the PCCC. Adoption assessment showed knowledge
   increases after clinical training on Modern Contraception (85\%
   pre-training, 95\% post-training) and Reproductive Justice (RJ) (58\%
   pre-training, 70\% post-training). Implementation assessment found that
   most Community Advisory Board members felt ICAN! was responsive to
   community needs. Conclusions: The ICAN! demonstration year increased
   provider knowledge and volume of reproductive care at three Illinois
   FQHCs. Implications: Contraceptive access initiatives that
   operationalize same day access to birth control methods while training
   FQHC providers on RJ and modern contraception, show promise on several
   measures. Early evidence from ICAN! indicates increased reproductive
   health service provision, as well as increases in provider knowledge of
   RJ and modern contraceptive care.},

Abstract = {Living in a wasted world is an educational problem that requires a
   radical shift in more-than-human relationships. Education has served as
   a means for re/producing socio-ecological waste by legitimizing
   discrimination among earthly beings. Ecofeminism reveals a common
   mechanism underlying different hierarchies as well as embodied
   connections between more-than-human beings. I explore an alternative way
   to envision more-than-human education in a wasted world by combining
   ecofeminism with other fields. First, the relationship between
   more-than-human subordination and more-than-human entanglement is
   investigated in terms of waste-bodies. As waste-bodies reflect a crisis
   of world reproduction, I examine how gendered reproduction, education,
   and waste reinforce each other while creating fissures. The ferality of
   waste-bodies breaks forth from the ruptures, forming a more-than-human
   sociality. This creates a space for an ecofeminist education of ecotone
   that appreciates the exuberance of the liminal. I suggest
   more-than-human education as a transspecies responsibility materialized
   through sensual kinship with the world.},

Abstract = {In Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization (2022), the U.S. Supreme
   Court overturned decades of precedent regarding the federal right to an
   abortion for people who can carry pregnancies. This case has substantial
   significance for the education field, directly affecting school- and
   college-age marginalized students who can carry pregnancies. In this
   essay, I argue that Dobbs and subsequent policies have created a
   significant need for educational research to inform courts, public
   policy, and practice to improve social and educational structural
   support for marginalized students who can carry pregnancies in a
   post-Dobbs era. This need is because Dobbs and subsequent policies have
   significantly diminished reproductive justice, and reproductive justice
   is intricately tied to marginalized students' ability to fully engage in
   their education. Timely educational research is critical to address the
   systemic inequities that Dobbs and related policies have exacerbated and
   reified.},

Abstract = {We argue that discourses around forced sterilization and abortion
   restrictions too often focus on motherhood and fertility and ignore the
   multiple other harms they bring. To do this, we travel with the North
   American framework of reproductive justice (RJ) to think through
   experiences of (non)reproduction in Peru and consider its analytic
   possibilities. In this intervention, we wish to focus on the commonality
   between RJ's three tenets: the figure of the child and its analytic
   force. We argue that while the aim of the RJ framework is not to reify
   fetuses and children at the expense of adults nor to reinforce a
   pronatalist position, the fact that the tenets are formulated around
   children means that, when mobilized for political or analytical
   purposes, they can reinforce repronormative mandates. We use the
   examples of forced sterilization and abortion in Peru to consider the
   issues this figuration of the child brings into being and the landscape
   of meaning it produces.},

Volume = {19},

Abstract = {This article examines the discourses and strategies used by reproductive
   rights activists in Turkey to counter the state `s antiabortion
   policies. Drawing on a critical genealogical analysis, the article first
   traces the concept of ``bodily autonomy `` in feminist mobilizations
   against sexual and ethnoracial violence from the 1980s to the first
   decade of the 2000s. It then focuses on the slogan of the 2012 abortion
   rights mobilizations, ``My body, my decision!, `` which relies on bodily
   autonomy as the central trope of claim making. The article argues that
   the slogan is limited, not because it draws on a liberal,
   individualistic framework but because it represents the bodily autonomy
   of the white reproductive subject, assuming that it is an ethnoracially
   unmarked, universal subject. In doing so, the article demonstrates how
   feminist strategies that build on bodily autonomy obscure the state `s
   strati fied reproductive policies, which have historically promoted a
   Turkish majority at the expense of nonTurkish lives.},

Abstract = {In dialogue with the rich scholarship on affect and the role of emotions
   in feminist knowledge production, this article explores how compassion
   is mobilized by activists in the struggle for reproductive justice. The
   author centers emotional knowledge by drawing on conversations with a
   reproductive justice advocate in central Florida, the musical anthem of
   Viva Ru \& iacute;z and the Thank God for Abortion Collective, and her
   own personal experience with pregnancy loss. This includes a discussion
   of the ways that coloniality persists in the racialized and gendered
   landscape of reproductive politics, with particular attention to the
   experiences of Puerto Ricans. Ultimately, the article argues that an
   attunement to ``a radical compassion{''}-that is, a deep concern and
   understanding of the intersectional oppressions that place value on
   certain bodies over others-engenders the possibilities of reproductive
   justice and produces alternative ways of knowing and feeling.},

Abstract = {Reproductive governance and anti-abortion discourse increased
   dramatically after the Dobbs decision ended Roe. To reproductive justice
   advocates, this decision came after the pandemic lockdown that left
   staff working from home and they see it as a human rights crisis. In
   light of these radical changes, how are reproductive justice debates
   framed in the United States by women of color? Drawing on ethnographic
   research, I suggest that while the abortion landscape has provoked more
   polarization, reproductive justice activists, particularly women of
   color, have deepened their commitment to their human rights and
   intersectional approach that advocates for the most structurally
   vulnerable.},

Abstract = {Since the US Supreme Court overturned Dobbs v Jackson, expanded access
   to abortion has been critical. Abortion is safe, and related
   complications are rare. The safety of abortion provision by advanced
   practice clinicians (APCs) is well documented. Despite the increase in
   targeted restrictions for patients and clinicians in many states
   post-Dobbs, in recent years there have been meaningful gains in
   recognition and codification of abortion as part of an expanded scope of
   practice for APCs. Thus, creating a formal written pathway for midwives
   to obtain privileges in abortion provision could also improve abortion
   access. In New York City's public health care system, the largest in the
   United States, midwives provide a significant portion of perinatal and
   gynecologic care. Yet, until recently, a process to privilege midwives
   in the provision of abortion services did not exist. In response,
   midwives and physicians at a large New York City hospital system sought
   key stakeholder support to develop a pathway for certified
   nurse-midwives and certified midwives, licensed midwives in New York
   state, to obtain the necessary training needed for independent abortion
   provision. This article describes the development of a midwifery-led
   pilot program to improve abortion access by increasing the availability
   of trained midwifery abortion providers, along with the results of staff
   meetings exploring attitudes toward abortion care by APCs. We report our
   safety statistics from this pilot program and share existing evidence
   for safety of abortion provision by midwives and other APCs.},

Abstract = {In September 2020, a gender reveal party started the El Dorado Fire in
   southern California. We analyzed comments on news coverage of the fire
   from two outlets with different political leanings to evaluate how the
   rhetorical process of assigning guilt is influenced by interlocking
   systems of power, making an intersectional lens useful for analyzing
   responses to environmental crises. Some comments evoked scapegoat
   ecology, which is a response to guilt that narrows the scope of climate
   change to the igniters of the wildfire. Other comments evoked what we
   call ecological transcendence, which replaces scapegoating with
   attention to systems-level concerns. In analyzing ecological
   transcendence, we outline differences between collective action
   mobilized by inclusive care and seemingly unifying discourses of
   selective care that foster marginalization and oppression. We contribute
   to environmental rhetoric and feminist studies by emphasizing the
   importance of attending to intersectionality in analyzing rhetorics of
   guilt in ecological contexts and through our proposal of ecological
   transcendence as an alternative to scapegoat ecology.},

Abstract = {Our legal system characterizes the unborn in a multiplicity of
   conflicting ways-from persons to property, from body parts to medical
   investments. The law of civil wrongs is instructive. It weighs in when
   misconduct deprives aspiring parents of the child they had hoped to
   have, whether the transgression takes place during pregnancy or before
   it. The torts and remedies that govern these cases are riddled with a
   confusion that comes from treating prenatal life as anything but
   coherent. The overturning of Roe v. Wade has cast new light on the
   neglected doctrine of reproductive loss and deepened a tension about the
   meaning of prenatal life in both private and public law.This Article
   undertakes the first study of jury verdicts for mismanaged pregnancies
   and mishandled embryos. This original empirical analysis reveals wildly
   erratic outcomes. And it lends insight into the influence of racial and
   class biases about ``wanted{''} children and ``deserving{''} parents. We
   introduce a framework with which juries should appraise these losses
   according to three factors. First is the subjective experience of losing
   a wanted baby. Second is the objective chance of having that baby if not
   for misconduct. Third is accompanying traumas, such as delivering a dead
   baby in a stillbirth. Each factor operates to promote reproductive
   justice and recover principle in how the law treats prenatal death
   across the landscape of civil awards and criminal restrictions.},

Abstract = {For individuals pursuing medically assisted gender transition,
   gender-affirming surgical treatments, such as oophorectomy (removal of
   the ovaries) and orchiectomy (removal of the testicles), cause
   sterility, and gender-affirming hormone treatment with medications
   (i.e., testosterone and estrogen) may negatively impact infertility. The
   major United States (US) medical associations already endorse fertility
   preservation (FP) through cryopreservation (i.e., ``freezing{''} egg and
   sperm) for transgender individuals. Despite these endorsements from the
   relevant medical societies, medical insurance coverage for FP remains
   very limited in the US. Given the high out-of-pocket costs for FP
   services, fertility preservation remains financially out of reach for
   many transgender individuals who may desire it. We present an ethical
   justification for universal FP coverage for all transgender and gender
   diverse (TGD) individuals who request this option during medically
   assisted gender transition. First, we argue that gender-affirming
   medical care is analogous to other medical interventions and treatment
   regimens that compromise fertility, such as cancer care, and that both
   types of interventions need to be afforded the same medical benefits and
   assistance in pursuing fertility goals. Second, we argue that the lack
   of FP for transgender individuals contributes to the ongoing and
   profound transphobia and anti-trans bias that has been exacerbated in
   the past several years across the healthcare landscape in the United
   States. We argue that the provision of FP coverage for transgender
   individuals is necessary for clinicians and third-party payers to state
   their unequivocal support for TGD patients and their healthcare needs.},

Abstract = {One of the most important facets of reproductive freedom and justice is
   the right to abortion. For centuries, the debate on legalisation and
   regulation of abortion has caused ethical dilemmas with proponents for
   both sides of the argument. India, a developing nation, with a wide
   spectrum of cultures, traditions, socio-economic statuses and religious
   beliefs, would be expected to be grappling with this problem. However,
   India since the 1970s made a clear stance on the matter of abortion.
   Respecting the right to personal liberty, reproductive freedom of women
   and upholding the importance of women's health, Medical Termination
   Pregnancy (MTP) has been legal in India since 1971. We look at the laws
   governing MTP in India, the practical and ethical considerations, the
   recent amendments in these laws and the road ahead.},

Abstract = {Reproductive coercion extends from a historical context in which the

   detention system. We end by compelling obstetrician-gynecologists to act
   as agents of change by leveraging their social, economic, and political
   power to resist and eliminate structures and norms that enable
   reproductive oppression of immigrant groups in detention.},

Abstract = {The abortion access landscape for patients has changed dramatically in
   the wake of the US Supreme Court Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health
   Organization decision in June of 2022. In response, the Division of
   Midwifery at Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, Massachusetts,
   began a medication abortion service for both established patients and
   those who may seek care from out of state. This service increases access
   to abortion care now while also providing the clinical experience needed
   for student nurse-midwives to become future abortion providers. This
   article outlines the steps taken to implement a medication abortion
   service and ways it can be adopted by other midwifery practices.
   Strategies to address possible clinical, administrative, and logistical
   challenges are addressed. Finally, this article is a call to action
   because midwives are well qualified to provide high quality, safe, and
   comprehensive medication abortion within the midwifery model of care.},

Abstract = {Between the late 1970s and 1990s, many indigenous Lisu people in the Nu
   River Valley, an Eastern Himalayan region of China bordering Myanmar and
   Tibet, underwent what they referred to as ``doing
   medicine{''}-abortions, vasectomies, and tubal ligations-as part of
   China's Birth Planning Policy. Lisu, who endured these procedures,
   struggle with strength loss, nervousness, and pain. Government
   discourses diminish the Lisu experience, arguing that the policy was
   lenient toward them. Lisu themselves are reticent to share their
   experiences but have devised new practices to care for those affected.
   Drawing on long-term ethnographic fieldwork, I argue that these chronic
   illnesses and accompanying care practices constitute everyday forms of
   remembering through which Lisu give shape to their experiences of
   cultural loss under Chinese colonization while generating new social
   relationships. This analysis sheds light on Indigenous experiences of
   birth planning in China with broader implications for understanding the
   bureaucratic violence of medicine.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study is to rethink the ethics of advanced motherhood. In
   the literature, delayed childbearing is usually discussed in the context
   of reproductive justice, and in relationship to ethical issues
   associated with the use and risk of assisted reproductive technologies.
   We aim to go beyond these more ``traditional{''} ways in which
   reproductive ethics is framed by revisiting ethics itself through the
   lens of the figure of the so-called ``older{''} mother. For this
   purpose, we start by exploring some of the deep seated socio-cultural
   discourses in the context of procreation: ageism, ableism and the
   widespread bias towards geneticism and pronatalism. Afterwards, we
   provide a critical overview of the key arguments against or in support
   of advanced motherhood. We then briefly discuss how entrenchment by both
   sides has produced an impasse in the debate on the ethics of advanced
   motherhood and proceed by arguing that it is fundamental to bring about
   a change in this narrative. For this purpose, we will revisit the
   feminist usage of the concept of vulnerability which will allow us both
   to criticize culturally prescribed norms about motherhood and to address
   the painful reality of age-related fertility decline. In the last
   section, we argue that instead of defining ``older{''} motherhood as an
   ethical problem, we should problematize the fact that female
   reproductive ageing is an understudied and ill-sourced topic. We believe
   that allocating resources to research to better understand female
   reproductive ageing is not only ethically permissible, but might even be
   ethically desirable.},

Title = {For My Daughter Kakuya: Imagining Children at the End(s) of the World},
Journal = {RELIGIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic revealed individual and institutional anxieties
   about the apocalypse. Pastors and activists alike turned to the
   depiction of the apocalypse in popular media to describe the urgency of
   decisive action. Implicitly, these depictions offer a curious method for
   engaging and imagining children. Assata Shakur writes compelling poetry
   in her autobiography about her hopes for the world. In one poem,
   entitled For My Daughter Kakuya, I argue that Shakur engages in
   Afrofuturist speculative fiction as she envisions a future world for her
   daughter. This paper explores how writers living through these times
   themselves imagine Black children at the end of the world. What would
   happen if we took seriously the notion that the ``end of the world{''}
   is always at hand for Black people? This article explores the
   stomach-turning warning that Jesus offers in Mark 13:14-19 regarding
   those who are ``pregnant and nursing in those days{''}. Using a
   reproductive justice lens, this paper explores the eternal challenge of
   imagining and stewarding a future in which Black children are safe and
   thriving. It also explores the limits and possibilities of partnering
   with radical Black faith traditions to this end.},

Abstract = {This essay engages contemporary narratives of black maternal ambivalence
   to unsettle residual attachments to choice within the frame of
   reproductive justice. The contemporary fiction of Brit Bennett's The
   Mothers and Tayari Jones's An American Marriage, as well as Black
   feminist work on Assisted Reproductive Technologies, reconsider the
   difficult ways that race and `choice' have been in tension with each
   other in political and medical discourse around reproductive rights.
   Feminist choice debates have been intentionally reframed away from
   `rights' and toward `justice' as an attempt to account for the
   hyper-control of Black reproduction across a modern history that
   includes enslavement, mass incarceration, and myths of
   hyper-reproduction. Complex narrative accounts of thwarted or uncertain
   Black reproduction built from the embodied experiences of blackness can
   consider both choice and justice without romanticising motherhood or
   autonomy. This article troubles the weight on black feminism to conceive
   and carry children - symbolic and material - into and through precarious
   life chances into secure (political) futures. Through thick descriptions
   of the reproductive that run through desire, uncertainty, debt, and
   vulnerability, black feminist thought and expressive culture can
   displace autonomy as the underpinning and endgame of feminist
   reproductive politics.},

   deeply divisive political debates - abortion rights and mask wearing

   concerning pro-choice to the rights of individuals to refuse to comply
   with mask mandates. Underpinning the values of each is a white liberal
   racism that operates to uphold dominant gender, class and economic
   structures.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF TRANSCULTURAL NURSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {34},
Number = {5},
Pages = {375-388},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Objective: There are approximately 231,000 women detained daily within
   the nation's jail and prison systems with women of color making up
   nearly half of those experiencing incarceration. The purpose of this
   scoping review was to synthesize the literature on the reproductive
   autonomy of Black women influenced by incarceration, using the three
   tenets of reproductive justice. Methods: We searched PubMed, CINAHL,
   SocINDEX, and PsycINFO for research related to reproductive justice
   written in English and published in the United States from 1980 to 2022.
   A review of 440 article titles and abstracts yielded 32 articles for
   full-text review; nine articles met inclusion. Results: Eight addressed
   Tenet 1; five mentioned Tenet 2; none addressed Tenet 3. Recognition of
   the influence of incarceration on the reproductive autonomy of Black
   women is limited. Conclusion: The findings from this review suggest a
   need to address (a) reproductive choice, (b) support goals, and (c)
   support of justice-involved Black women.},

Abstract = {Equitable access to fertility care remains precarious and often
   dependent upon definitional rhetoric of infertility, which insurance
   policies and state legislators use to determine access to alternative
   family building options. This article builds upon prior rhetorical
   scholarship on infertility by applying an embodied rhetorics framework
   to capture the resilience infertile persons exhibit when faced with
   barriers to build their family. To do this, I share a series of texts
   self-identified infertile advocates produced as they reflected on their
   encounters with barriers to accessing care and building their families.
   As a disease that requires self-disclosure as a form of advocacy, I
   analyze the visual and written texts produced through an embodied
   rhetorics framework. These texts are forms of public advocacy in that
   they make visible the multiple embodied misconceptions infertile persons
   navigate when trying to build one's family. I discuss these texts as
   illustrating ``misconception fatigue{''} which is affective toll that
   accumulates when advocating for one's reproductive right to have a
   family. I conclude by encouraging other rhetorical scholars committed to
   reproductive justice to adopt an embodied rhetorics framework to their
   scholarship and develop participatory research projects to support the
   advocacy needs of marginalized reproductive health communities.},

Abstract = {This article is an edited version of a conversation between Barbara
   Ransby and Derecka Purnell, two US-based key Black feminist activists on
   `New lines of Black resistance in the US: undoing racial capitalism and
   the carceral state', which took place at the `New Circuits of
   Anti-racism Conference', King's College London, October 2022 (IRR50).
   They discuss their own political journeys, shared by many activists
   today, which they describe as involving building and re-envisioning a
   desired future, as well as the role of Black feminism and abolition. The
   conversation, introduced by Chantelle Lewis of Surviving Society and
   Sophia Siddiqui of Race \& Class, unpacks the workings of the carceral
   state and the specific racial and class targeting of surplus Black
   workers. Drawing from their experience on the practicalities of
   organising today, they discuss their commitment to internationalism, the
   challenges of building genuine coalitions and the need to connect the
   dots between different systems of domination and violence to understand
   the functioning of the carceral state, and the centrality of
   reproductive justice and the fight for bodily autonomy.},

Title = {Unwanted or Mistimed Pregnancy and Developmental Issues in Ecuadorian
   Children Aged 3 to 5: A Doubly Robust Estimate Using Data from the
   National Health and Nutrition Survey 2018},
Journal = {MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH JOURNAL},

Abstract = {BackgroundPast studies in high-income countries have shown an
   association between unintended (unwanted or mistimed) pregnancy and
   child development; no national-level studies in low-and-middle-income
   countries have been conducted. Moreover, extant studies often adjust for
   potential mediators, underestimating the average population
   effect.MethodsWe aimed to estimate the effect of unintended pregnancy on
   early childhood development in Ecuadorian children aged 3 to 5,
   participating in the National Health and Nutrition Survey 2018. We used
   a design-based doubly robust estimate. First, we used propensity score
   matching (1:1) to identify a subsample equally likely to come from a
   desired vs. unintended pregnancy based on geographic area, household
   income, paternal intendedness, the mother's current marital status, age,
   ethnicity, and educational level, depressive symptoms, and the child's
   gender and age. Then, we used a logistic regression model to explore the
   relation of maternal pregnancy intentions with adequate development, as
   defined by the Early Childhood Development Index (ECDI). While exempt
   from review by an Institutional Review Board, this secondary research
   was conducted in accord with prevailing ethical principles.ResultsAmong
   1694 observations representing 162,285 Ecuadorian children, unintended
   pregnancy associated with inadequate development (odds ratio: 1.56; 95\%
   confidence interval: 1.06; 2.29), after adjusting for all relevant
   confounders. Unintended pregnancy was also negatively associated with
   all four ECDI domains, socio-emotional development being the most
   affected.DiscussionOur doubly robust design found evidence of the
   relation between the maternal perception of pregnancy and early child
   development. Addressing this relation to achieve reproductive justice
   entails considering a wide spectrum of population health and legal
   interventions to allow adequate access to education, contraception, and
   safe abortion. Moreover, pre- and post-natal check-ups could screen for
   unintended pregnancy and provide support accordingly.
   SignificanceWhat is already known on this subject? Studies from
   developed countries have shown an association between unintended
   pregnancy and early child development. Such contexts are not
   transferable to developing economies and cultures.What this study adds?
   Using a doubly robust estimate and avoiding known mediators, we provide
   the first national-level average population effect estimation of
   unintended pregnancy on child development from low-and-middle-income
   countries. Ecuadorian children born from unintended pregnancies had a
   42\% increased risk of having inadequate development, as measured by the
   Early Childhood Development Index (ECDI), at ages 3 to 5 compared to
   wanted children. Inadequate development was found in each of the ECDI
   domains: numeracy and literacy, social-emotional development, physical
   development, and approaches to learning.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we apply the reproductive justice framework to discuss
   how gendered racism disadvantages pregnant and parenting young Black
   women aging out of foster care. Specifically, we highlight the reversal
   of Roe v Wade as reflective of the United States' long legacy of efforts
   to control Black women's reproduction. We then discuss the structural
   factors contributing to the reproductive injustices of young Black women
   aging out of care, including a lack of access to sexual and reproductive
   health education, barriers to educational attainment, and foster
   care-based relational and placement deficits. We conclude with research,
   practice, and policy enhancements.},

Abstract = {Hersey et al have outlined a proposed ethical framework for assessing
   abortion policies that locates the effect of government legislation
   between the provider and the patient, emphasising its influence on
   interactions between them. They claim that their framework offers an
   alternative to the personal moral claims that lie behind legislation
   restricting abortion access. However, they fail to observe that their
   own understanding of reproductive justice and the principles of medical
   ethics are similarly predicated on their individual moral beliefs.
   Consequently, the conclusions obtained from their framework are also
   derived from their individual beliefs, and have no claim to being
   objective.},

Abstract = {The U.S. Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade in its Dobbs decision
   in June 2022 came as a shock. Yet, upon reflection, the decision simply
   reinforced what history has shown: women's rights and opportunities have
   always been subject to controls, fluctuations, and specious rationales.
   Dobbs is one in a long line of legal edicts in the U.S. and elsewhere
   that either allow or curtail and control female agency, including
   reproductive agency. The decision's devastating consequences for U.S.
   women's reproductive lives are damaging enough, but they are only part
   of the story. In addition to its hobbling effects on reproductive rights
   and justice, the Dobbs decision goes hand in hand with the underlying
   causes of today's unparalleled environmental emergency. This article
   argues, through ecofeminist theory and feminist and Native American
   climate fiction, that Dobbs is a catalyst for understanding the role of
   patriarchy-as a particularly insidious form of androcentrism-in the
   destruction of our planet. Evidence is mounting to support claims made
   by ecofeminists since the 1970s: patriarchy and resulting masculinist
   values have been foundational to the extractive and exploitative
   attitudes and practices regarding marginalized peoples, colonized lands,
   and racialized entitlements to natural resources that have endangered
   the earth's biosystems.},

Journal = {CHILDREN \& SOCIETY},

Abstract = {Empowerment evaluation (EE) is an especially useful tool that enables
   people to be involved in both individual and group transformation
   processes, in particular in contexts characterized by social inequality.
   By using a participatory approach, this methodological article analyses
   an Empowerment Evaluation experience within the European RoMoMatteR
   project. This project, which focuses on the notion of reproductive
   justice, has involved a group of Roma girls from Alicante (Spain), in a
   context characterized by discrimination based on ethnicity, gender and
   age, as well as by structural determinants such as social exclusion. The
   main research objective has been to analyse the relevance of the
   methodology designed to assess how project participants have developed a
   sense of autonomy and the acquisition of socio-cultural resources as
   assets for their future life choices. Therefore, the study design has
   followed the model proposed by Fetterman for Empowerment Evaluation:
   establishing a mission to be assessed, participatory diagnosis of the
   current status and finally planning for the future to start the desired
   change. Fetterman's model was adapted by designing and organizing
   participatory workshops with the girls involved in the project. The
   results confirm the relevance of the methodological proposal of the
   workshops to engage aspects of empowerment. The findings also allow to
   detect the empowerment of the Roma girls especially in two areas of the
   project: reaching the proposed objectives and the methodology used to
   register significant information. In the first case, the results show
   that Roma girls' establish a critical perspective on the idea of
   reproductive justice, and related to this, the activation of proactive
   behaviours linked to the acquisition of socio-cultural resources in the
   development of visions of their personal futures. In the second case,
   the Roma girls have also shown empowerment in decision-making on
   technical aspects, methodological design and taking action aimed at the
   collective construction of useful information in the project.},

   The Reproductive Justice Implications of Blood Quantum Requirements},
Journal = {CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {111},
Number = {1},
Pages = {287-324},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Blood often serves as the basis for identity for many groups in the
   United States. Native Americans, however, are the only population in
   which blood is a requirement for collective belonging and can be the
   determining factor for whether one receives tribal benefits and
   services. Many Tribal Nations use blood quantum, the percentage of
   Indian blood one has, as a bright-line rule to determine qualification
   for tribal membership. Initially established as a colonial tool of
   dispossession and assimilation, tribes adopted blood quantum to ensure
   the preservation of culture and community.This Article contends that
   tribal adoption of blood quantum limits tribal members' reproductive
   autonomy and violates the tenets of reproductive justice. Forcing tribal
   members to consider the blood quantum of their future children limits
   individual choice of partner and the manner in which tribal members
   choose to build their families. This limitation of autonomy and
   violation of reproductive justice principles is especially stark when
   analyzed in combination with contemporary pressures on Native conception
   and parenting, including urban migration, dysgenic environmental impacts
   on fertility, sexual violence, and inadequate, underfunded, and abusive
   reproductive healthcare. Collectively, these pressures decrease
   fertility, the number of available partners, and the ability for Native
   people to conceive and parent within their own communities.},

Abstract = {South Africa has an abortion law which codifies the broad themes of
   reproductive rights set out in the Constitution of South Africa, other
   laws and national guidelines. Certain wording of the conditions in the
   Choice Act for abortion after 20 weeks' gestation, are open to
   interpretation, being `severe malformation of the fetus' and `risk of
   injury to the fetus'. From 24 weeks onwards, abortion is carried out by
   feticide/induced fetal cardiac asystole ('IFCA') and subsequent
   induction of labour in South Africa. Some maternal-fetal units have
   developed guidelines to assist clinicians and patients in
   decision-making around eligibility for abortion after 20 weeks'
   gestation, given the broad terms in the law. We consider the guideline
   used by an institution in the Western Cape for abortion after 23 weeks
   and 6 days gestation, in terms of its alignment with the law on
   reproductive rights and its compliance with fair and transparent
   procedures. We also note its effect on respect for patients and on staff
   professionalism.},

Title = {Health Care and Adoption Service Experiences of People Who Placed
   Children for Adoption During Adolescence: A Qualitative Study},

Abstract = {Study Objective: To understand the perspectives of people who placed
   children for adoption during adolescence Design: We conducted
   qualitative interviews with adults who placed children for adoption
   during adolescence. We recruited participants through social media and
   two adoption-related organizations. We audio-recorded and transcribed
   interviews. Using thematic analysis, 2 investigators coded the
   transcripts and identified themes. Setting: Telephone interviews
   Participants: Adults ages 18-35 years old who placed children for
   adoption before they were 20 years old Interventions: Semi-structured
   telephone interviews Main Outcome Measures: Qualitative data Results: We
   conducted interviews with 18 individuals (median age of 32 years; range
   21-35 years). The median age at pregnancy was 18 years (range 13-19
   years). Seventeen participants identified as female and one as
   nonbinary. Themes included the following: (1) Negative experiences with
   counseling included limited empowerment to make choices about pregnancy
   or adoption options; (2) negative experi-ences with counseling included
   limited information about practical or financial support for pregnant
   adolescents; (3) negative experiences with the health care system
   included insensitivity or lack of awareness of the adoption plan at
   delivery; (4) positive experiences with counseling included
   comprehensive unbiased options counseling and adoption counseling
   emphasizing birth parent choice in openness and family placement; (5)
   positive experiences included longitudinal emotional support during
   pregnancy, particularly in ways that nor-malized adoption placement; and
   (6) participants desired therapy and/or psychological support following
   adoption placement. Conclusions: Individuals who chose adoption after
   adolescent pregnancy described positive and negative encounters with
   health care and adoption professionals that could serve as targets to
   improve the overall care experience for this population.},

Abstract = {Ableist attitudes and structures are increasingly recognized across all
   sectors of health care delivery. After Dobbs, novel questions arose in
   the United States concerning how to protect reproductive autonomy while
   avoiding discrimination against and devaluation of disabled persons. In
   this essay, we examine the Louisiana Department of Health's emergency
   declaration, ``List of Conditions That Shall Deem an Unborn Child
   `Medically Futile,'{''} issued August 1, 2022. We raise a number of
   medical, ethical, and public health concerns that lead us to argue that
   the declaration should be rescinded. Analysis of this ethically
   objectionable declaration provides valuable lessons about how to uphold
   both reproductive and disability justice in a post-Dobbs landscape.},

Volume = {18},

Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {We report on a comparative situational analysis of comprehensive
   abortion care (CAC) in Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho and Namibia. We
   conducted systematic literature searches and country consultations and
   used a reparative health justice approach (with four dimensions) for the
   analysis. The following findings pertain to all four countries, except
   where indicated. Individual material dimension: pervasive gender-based
   violence (GBV); unmet need for contraception (15-17\%); high HIV
   prevalence; poor abortion access for rape survivors; fees for sexual and
   reproductive health (SRH) services (Eswatini). Collective material
   dimension: no clear national budgeting for SRH; over-reliance on donor
   funding (Eswatini; Lesotho); no national CAC guidelines or guidance on
   legal abortion access; poor data collection and management systems;
   shortage and inequitable distribution of staff; few facilities providing
   abortion care. Individual symbolic dimension: gender norms justify GBV;
   stigma attached to both abortion and unwed or early pregnancies.
   Collective symbolic dimension: policy commitments to reducing unsafe
   abortion and to post-abortion care, but not to increasing access to
   legal abortion; inadequate research; contradictions in abortion
   legislation (Botswana); inadequate staff training in CAC. Political will
   to ensure CAC within the country's legislation is required. Reparative
   health justice comparisons provide a powerful tool for foregrounding
   necessary policy and practice change.},

Abstract = {When we conceptualized this symposium, Roe v. Wade(1) was still the law
   of the land, albeit precariously. We aimed to commemorate its fiftieth
   anniversary by exploring historical, legal, medical, and related
   dimensions of access to abortion as well as the challenges ahead to
   secure reproductive justice. With the leak of the U.S. Supreme Court's
   decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization on May 2, 2022,
   we shifted to mark the dawn of a new era. In the nearly identical
   official opinion announced on June 24, 2022,(2) Justice Samuel Alito,
   writing for the majority (6-3), overturned Roe and Planned Parenthood of
   Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey.(3)},

Abstract = {The global impact of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization and
   the backlash towards reproductive justice that it represents warrant a
   global feminist response informed by broad theoretical and geopolitical
   lenses. We consider how a solidaristic, transnational feminist movement
   might learn from Latin American feminist movements that have been
   successful in uniting broad coalitions in the fight for reproductive
   justice as situated within far-reaching political goals. The success of
   such a global movement must be decolonial and must contend with the fact
   that overlapping realities of global inequality, severe poverty,
   extractivism, and western-backed violence are fundamentally implicated
   in reproductive justice.},

   Ruth Ozeki's <i>All Over Creation</i>},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AMERICAN STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2, SI},
Abstract = {This article discusses women's reproductive agency and/or suppression in
   connection with biotechnological innovations in the agricultural
   industry, especially genetically modified crops (GMOs). To do so, it
   takes up Ruth Ozeki's creative response on this interconnection, the
   2002 novel All Over Creation, which utilizes a fictional farmer
   community in Idaho to address broader cultural issues such as sexism,
   racism, and reproductive justice. The analysis shows how All Over
   Creation first and foremost succeeds via a multivocal narrative to
   create a feminist response to both neoliberal biotechnological
   enhancements and dominant cultural notions of fertility, reproduction,
   and motherhood. At the same time, this article neglects the utopian
   potential that critics and reviewers have attributed to the text, and
   instead reveals how such a reading not only ignores substantial aspects
   of the novel's ideological complexity, but also unmasks a reader's
   complicity with (hetero-)normative understandings of reproduction.},

Title = {A critical commentary: Abortion stigma standing in the way of
   reproductive justice},
Journal = {AOTEAROA NEW ZEALAND SOCIAL WORK},

Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Abortion is part of reproductive healthcare problematised
   within politically charged debates, leading to ongoing attempts to
   control access. The lens of reproductive justice encompasses the right
   to choose to have, or not have, a child, and the right to experience the
   enabling conditions to act on that choice. Abortion as part of health
   care is often limited by stigma, place and culture, as well as the
   regulatory environment.APPROACH: In light of the recent changes to
   abortion law in Aotearoa New Zealand it is timely to review what is
   known about the impact of abortion stigma. Legal changes may improve
   access, but stigma endures. In a rapid literature review, we reviewed
   scholarly articles published between 2009 and 2023 that address abortion
   stigma. FINDINGS: Our review identified two temporal frames: consistency
   of abortion stigma over time and changes over time. Within the frame of
   consistency over time, we identified three enduring themes in this body
   of literature, namely, the impact of religion/religiosity, the
   personification of the foetus, and secrecy. More recent scholarship
   addresses the intersectional dimensions of abortion stigma, abortion and
   the online environment, and the focus on the wider targets of abortion
   stigma.CONCLUSIONS: Social workers benefit from an understanding of how
   various forms of stigma impact on the lives of people we support.
   Abortion stigma has similar impacts as stigma in mental health or
   disability and its elimination should be supported by social work.},

Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Whilst acknowledging that child-welfare-involved pregnant
   women occupy a uniquely precarious position in terms of their human
   dignity and rights, this paper focuses on the vulnerabilities of fathers
   of children subject to child protection assessment before the birth of a
   child.APPROACH: This article draws on data from two qualitative research
   studies, both focused on social work practice in Scotland. The first
   study created ethnographic data with and about eight fathers who were
   experiencing pre-birth child protection involvement with their babies.
   The second study did not include fathers themselves, yet research data
   were created through interviews with 10 birth mothers, which reinforced
   findings of the prior research in relation to men being written out of
   planning and legal processes before their children were born.FINDINGS:
   Taking a reproductive justice lens to the findings of the two studies
   reveals how this population of fathers are exposed to legal and social
   precarity in relation to their paternal role. Through the advice of
   social workers, women were encouraged not to name the fathers of their
   as yet unborn infants on their child's birth certificate, creating an
   immediate barrier to fathers' involvement. IMPLICATIONS: The article
   demonstrates that a reproductive justice framework (L. Ross \& Solinger,
   2017) can be applied in order to understand how men's rights to parent
   their children may be compromised by child protection involvement in the
   family. Acknowledging the power held by social workers is a crucial
   first step in beginning to address the social inequalities around
   ``reproductive destiny{''} (L. Ross, 2006, p. 4) experienced by fathers.},

Abstract = {In 2022, the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and thus
   ended the legal protection of access to abortion at the federal level.
   Using techniques of corpus linguistics paired with critical discourse
   analysis, this article examines how the word abortion is used in a
   corpus of newspaper reports covering the decision. The analysis uncovers
   a staunch position of the right to abortion as an abstracted notion,
   alongside a simultaneous legitimation of individuals acting on those
   rights in order to construct them as worthy. In essence, the news media
   discursively reproduce a hegemonic order that demands adherence to the
   system, valorises responsible subjects and obscures structural
   inequities of gender, race and class in the name of freedom of choice.
   Echoing the call of Black and Indigenous feminist activists, this
   article argues for a shift in discourse towards one of reproductive
   justice.},

   violate reproductive justice for parents with disabilities. These bans
   deprive people with disabilities of choices that may be important to
   their possibilities of becoming parents, including possibilities for

Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This article explores women's experiences of menstrual
   suppression within the New Zealand Army while seeking to understand the
   influence of military systems, culture and processes on those
   experiences. More specifically, it examines women's desire for menstrual
   concealment and control over their chosen method of managing their
   menstruation.METHODS: Data were collected using narrative interviews
   with 18 women currently serving in the New Zealand Army and nine key
   informants. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis.
   FINDINGS: Study participants described the convenience of not having
   their period in a military environment as their main reasoning for
   menstrual suppression. Whether supressing their period or not, women's
   stories revealed their desire to fit in within the current military
   culture while also having control over their own body and
   decision-making. The decision on how they managed their menstruation was
   influenced by their peers, their rank, their environment, their past
   experiences and the information provided to them through briefings and
   visits with their medical provider. CONCLUSION: The preliminary findings
   from this study suggests that within the military, women are not only
   expected to keep their feminine identity but also maintain body
   equivalence with men to ensure they are seen as equally operationally
   effective. Although women describe an expectation of menstrual
   concealment, women choose how they reach that expectation. A
   reproductive justice lens is used to argue that without addressing
   menstrual stigma and the military structures, women will continue to
   ``choose{''} to conceal or supress their period as it is presented as
   the only appropriate choice.},

Journal = {AOTEAROA NEW ZEALAND SOCIAL WORK},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4},
Pages = {45-58},
Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This article draws on understandings from reproductive
   justice, crip and queer theories to discuss gonadectomy for children and
   young people with gonadal variations. Gonadectomy is sometimes performed
   on people with gonadal variations without their free and informed
   consent. Some parents report experiencing pressure to consent to such
   surgery when their children are young. We understand this to be an issue
   of reproductive justice.METHOD: Semi-structured interviews were
   conducted with parents of affected children and young people (n = 13).
   Thematic coding was used to identify data relating to gonads, ovaries,
   testes and gonadectomy. The data were analysed using discursive
   questions drawn from a reproductive justice framework.ANALYSIS: Parents'
   talk about gonads suggests a process of sense-making that can be
   emotionally challenging. Our analysis situates their talk within broader
   societal discourses of ablebodiedness and the sex binary. Parents
   explained their choices and decisions by centring various
   understandings. Some explained how gonadectomy made sense for
   maintaining binary sex and following medical advice. Others emphasised
   the child's consent and bodily autonomy. Our analysis draws out how
   parents' decisions navigate reproductive justice and
   injustice.CONCLUSIONS: Dominant beliefs about ablebodiedness and the sex
   binary appear to influence and frame decision-making about the gonads of
   children and young people with variations in sex characteristics. A
   crip, queer, and reproductive justice lens allows us to expand
   understandings of reproductive justice for all and potentially helps to
   destabilise and disrupt the sex binary.},

Pages = {543-616},
Abstract = {This Article explores judicial responses to miscarriage under federal
   employment law in the United States. Miscarriage is a common experience.
   Of confirmed pregnancies, about 15\% will end in miscarriage; almost
   half of all women who have given birth have suffered a miscarriage. Yet,
   this experience slips through the cracks of every major federal
   employment law in the United States.
   The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, for example, defines sex
   discrimination to include discrimination on the basis of pregnancy,
   childbirth, or related medical conditions. The Family and Medical Leave
   Act of 1993 requires covered employers to provide employees with
   job-protected, unpaid leave for personal or family illness. The
   Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 mandates both nondiscrimination
   and reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities. The
   Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 is supposed to ensure that
   American workplaces are free of recognized hazards that may cause
   serious physical harm to workers. However, as this Article demonstrates,
   none of these laws clearly addresses the experience of miscarriage.
   Moreover, courts and agencies often refuse to interpret these statutes
   in obvious and reasonable ways to provide meaningful equality to workers
   when they suffer the common experience of miscarriage.
   Many scholars have examined the limitations of employment law with
   regard to pregnancy. This Article is the first to comprehensively
   examine this problem as it relates to miscarriage. In addition to
   bringing attention to this important issue, which silently affects so
   many workers, this Article provides an opportunity to challenge the
   artificial conceptual separation of employment and health law, as well
   as to consider the problem of pregnancy discrimination through the
   broader lens of reproductive justice.},

Title = {Obstacles to Exercising Reproductive Rights for Single Women in China
   and Legal Recommendations},
Journal = {RISK MANAGEMENT AND HEALTHCARE POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Pages = {2125-2138},
Abstract = {Purpose: Reproductive rights represent an intrinsic and pivotal human
   entitlement, encompassing legal protection for procreation. Essential to
   this framework is the recognition that single women equally deserve
   reproductive rights. Although Chinese legislation refrains from overtly
   disallowing reproductive rights for single women, the interplay of
   conventional marriage norms and family planning policies has
   inadvertently tied these rights to marital status, consequently
   constraining single women's ability to assert them. The establishment of
   a robust legal structure to ensure reproductive rights for single women
   would profoundly contribute to advancing a harmonious evolution of
   China's population dynamics.
   Patients and Methods: We employ meticulous textual scrutiny to analyze
   comprehensively the stipulations concerning women's reproductive
   liberties within the framework of Chinese jurisprudence. Furthermore, we
   engage in empirical inquiry to enumerate and elucidate the multifarious
   constraints placed upon the reproductive freedoms of unmarried women in
   the Chinese context. This endeavor entails a detailed exposition and
   incisive examination of China's limitations imposed upon the
   reproductive rights of single women, encompassing both legal strictures
   and policy dimensions.
   Results: The absence of legal endorsement and safeguarding has given
   rise to substantial impediments to the exercise of reproductive rights
   among single women in China. Not only do endeavors to assert
   reproductive rights on behalf of single women encounter intricate
   challenges in judicial implementation, but they also encounter manifold
   barriers within national policies. This predicament not only subjects
   single women to considerable psychological strain but also contradicts
   the overarching objective of achieving a harmonized population
   development trajectory in China.
   Conclusion: China should expedite the development of a legal framework
   for protecting reproductive rights that includes provisions for
   supporting single women to have children. This legal apparatus should
   efficaciously enshrine and shield the reproductive rights of single
   women, thus playing a pivotal role in advancing a more equitable and
   well-balanced trajectory of population development.},

Title = {Abortion counselling controversies and the precarious role of social
   work: Research and reflections from Aotearoa New Zealand},
Journal = {AOTEAROA NEW ZEALAND SOCIAL WORK},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4},
Pages = {73-86},
Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This article presents debates and controversies about
   counselling within abortion provision in Aotearoa New Zealand. Formal
   and informal counselling networks are described, where the role of
   social workers as providers of counselling services is precarious.
   Insights consider how service users may be more holistically supported
   when accessing abortion care.METHODS: Drawing on findings from a broader
   qualitative research project involving 52 participant interviews, formal
   and informal observation of practices, and analysis of service
   documentation, the concept of boundary objects by Star and Griesemer
   (1989) is taken up to account for diverse abortion counselling practices
   that occur in multiple but connected social worlds. Revisiting these
   findings in the context of current abortion legislation and
   developments, a Reproductive Justice (RJ) lens is used to inform the
   implications for service users and social work practice. FINDINGS: Past
   and present efforts within legislation, policy, and practice guidelines
   to standardise abortion counselling have not prevented different
   versions of counselling from being enacted by social workers,
   counsellors, nurses, medical practitioners, staff of community agencies,
   and crisis pregnancy services. This has resulted in the practice and the
   term counselling being contested. Participant accounts and observations
   revealed that multiple disciplines offer counselling practices while
   social work remains poorly integrated into service provision.CONCLUSION:
   This article employs the concept of boundary objects to account for how
   variations of counselling have been enacted and disputed. The addition
   of a reproductive justice (RJ) lens with its attention to social justice
   is used to appreciate recent advances in access to abortion services
   alongside arguing for enriched care practices and the value of social
   work in supporting the integrated well-being and agency of service
   users.},

   about how these fields collude and collide with the notions of the right
   to have a child, delivering accessible services, and how regulations are
   applied? METHODS: This study used a qualitative, multi-methods approach.
   I conducted 27 face-to-face semi-structured interviews and ran an online
   survey (88 responses). Questions focused around the decision making and
   experiences of lesbian women in conception, maternity and family spaces.
   FINDINGS: This research found the path to, and through, fertility
   clinics in Aotearoa New Zealand may be easier for those who embody
   privilege, that is those who present as white, wealthy, heterosexual,
   and feminine. Exclusions are practised through policy, wording,
   inference, and behaviour. IMPLICATIONS: Fertility clinics demonstrate
   the inequity of reproductive justice. Normative understandings underpin
   the right to have a child, accessible services, and the application of
   regulations. These understandings work to trouble paths to parenthood,
   not only for lesbians, but for many others within and across a variety
   of other groups. Access to, and movement through, these spaces can
   strongly reinforce narrow understandings of family. Fertility clinics
   not only create families, but also reproduce particular types of family.},

Journal = {AOTEAROA NEW ZEALAND SOCIAL WORK},

Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In this article we focus on two women's movements,
   Abortion Rights in Australia and the Iranian women's protests, that have
   resisted dominant oppressive discourses and systems. These movements
   have pushed back on the regulation of women's bodies, choice, and
   reproductive rights, and are demanding social justice against violence,
   key areas of concern for critical social work (CSW).METHODS: The
   theoretical lenses of feminist transnationalism and intersectionality
   will inform critical analysis based on our case studies describing
   activism on reproductive justice (RJ) and social justice.FINDINGS: Both
   movements centre women's choice and control over their bodies-in one
   case, the removal of access to abortion in the USA (United States of
   America) has incited protests to protect women's reproductive right to
   choose, and in the other, Iranian women have taken to the streets to
   demand their rights to gender equality and protest the systematic
   violence against women and their bodies. Consideration of the
   contribution of women's activism to social work education is
   presented.CONCLUSION: While these movements are not equivalent, they
   demonstrate political and collective activism to fight for women's right
   to choose. The article concludes with how social movements can help us
   develop strategies of hope and collective action. The pedagogy of
   solidarity and community of practice can amplify social work education
   to both reflect and encourage activism.},

Abstract = {Starting from the premise that the agenda on reproductive rights is home
   to political disputes in the field of sexuality and reproduction, this
   article reviews the debate held at the public hearing on the Argument of
   Noncompliance with a Fundamental Precept (Arguicao de Descumprimento de
   Preceito Fundamental, ADPF) \# 442 in August 2018. The lawsuit proposes
   the decriminalization of abortion induced by the pregnant woman herself
   or with her consent until the 12th week of gestation. At the hearing
   convened by the Supreme Court, 50 amicus curiae presentations were held,
   catalyzing the current arguments raised in the public debate on abortion
   in Brazil. The content of the public hearing (characters, places,
   images, audios, texts, and video) is taken as empirical material for
   this research. Considering the centrality of the defense of
   life/combating death argument, both in speeches for and against the
   ADPF, we examine the different frameworks used by political actors on
   the scene when debating the issue of abortion in terms of a clash
   between death and life. More than a polysemy, it is a clash that makes
   explicit hierarchies regarding reproduction and women's lives.},

Abstract = {The concept of reproductive justice is currently receiving a lot of
   attention in counterhegemonic feminisms. The concept emerged in clear
   opposition to an individualizing understanding of reproductive rights
   that characterized the U. S. pro-choice movements and also the
   post-Cairo international antinatalist population programs.1
   Transnationally, feminist movements refer to the concept when
   challenging structural inequalities related to reproduction and
   parenthood. For these reasons, the concept of reproductive justice is
   also a landmark in the critique of Malthusian crisis narratives and
   demographic governance strategies. This chapter explores how Black and
   popular feminism are adopting the concept currently in Brazil. In the
   first section, the chapter deals with implications for agenda setting
   and reflects the movements' strong reference to necropolitical
   dimensions of reproductive relations. Three elements of agenda setting
   are explored: addressing structural inequality within `classical'
   reproductive health issues; the attention to antinatalist strategies,
   such as a continuous policy of sterilization; and experiences of
   motherhood/parenthood being stigmatized or attacked. In the second
   section, the chapter explores another level of meaning of reproductive
   justice, namely that of being a framework for intersectional feminist
   alliances. Therefore, it deals with how the movements negotiate
   different positionalities and the question of allyship within their
   everyday convivialities. The movements negotiate these organizational
   challenges by reflecting processes of collective repositioning in a
   complex way and by referring to important concepts of contemporary
   antiracist and social movements in Brazil, such as nao lugar,
   aquilombamento, and bem-viver.},

Title = {Barriers to accessing assisted reproduction for diverse and minority
   groups in Aotearoa New Zealand: Findings from a qualitative study},
Journal = {AOTEAROA NEW ZEALAND SOCIAL WORK},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4},
Pages = {102-111},
Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: There is now an extensive body of international research
   on fertility help -seeking. While this body of work has historically
   centred the experiences of dominant ethnicities and heterosexual and
   cisgender couples and families, our study attends to the experiences of
   individuals and couples from diverse and minority groups in Aotearoa New
   Zealand, for which, to date, there is little research. In the article,
   we report delays and disparities accessing assisted reproduction for
   these groups to advocate for fertility care based on reproductive
   justice.METHODS: The article draws on semi-structured interviews and
   talanoa from a qualitative study conducted during 2020 and 2021 with 39
   Ma over bar ori, Pa over bar keha over bar , and Pacific people residing
   in Aotearoa New Zealand who have experienced fertility issues for social
   or medical reasons and have sought reproductive assistance, using a
   range of procedures and treatments, to create families.FINDINGS: To
   better understand the reproductive journeys of people from these groups
   we report the challenges identified by study participants in the process
   of decision-making around accessing assisted reproduction and fertility
   treatment help-seeking. Importantly, we document a range of situational
   and structural fertility barriers that point to stratified reproduction
   relating to affordability, delays and long wait times for resources and
   services, discrimination, and non -inclusive care.CONCLUSION: To address
   these issues, we recommend improvement to fertility treatment services
   and delivery that is culturally accessible, responsive, and equitable.
   This entails attending to the structural constraints that prevent people
   from accessing and obtaining the resources needed to realise their
   family building goals.},

Title = {Some key questions: Pregnancy intention screening by community health
   workers},
Journal = {WOMENS HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {19},
Abstract = {Background:Unintended pregnancy contributes to a high burden of maternal
   and fetal morbidity in the United States, and pregnancy intention
   screening offers a key strategy to improve preconception health and
   reproductive health equity. The One Key Question (c) is a pregnancy
   intention screening tool that asks a single question, ``Would you like
   to become pregnant in the next year?{''} to all reproductive-age women.
   This study explored the perspectives of community health workers on
   using One Key Question in community-based settings.Objectives:This study
   aimed to identify barriers and facilitators to the use of the One Key
   Question pregnancy intention screening tool by community health workers
   who serve reproductive-age women in Salt Lake City, Utah.Design:Using
   reproductive justice as a guiding conceptual framework, this study
   employed a qualitative descriptive design. Participants were asked to
   identify barriers and facilitators to the One Key Question, with
   open-ended discussion to explore community health workers' knowledge and
   perceptions about pregnancy intention screening.Methods:We conducted
   focus groups with 43 community health workers in Salt Lake City, Utah,
   from December 2017 through January 2018. Participants were trained on
   the One Key Question algorithm and asked to identify barriers and
   facilitators to implementation. All focus groups occurred face-to-face
   in community settings and used a semi-structured facilitation guide
   developed by the study Principal Investigator with input from community
   partners.Results:Pregnancy intention screening is perceived positively
   by community health workers. Barriers identified include traditional
   cultural beliefs about modesty and sex, lack of trust in health care
   providers, and female bias in the One Key Question algorithm.
   Facilitators include the simplicity of the One Key Question algorithm
   and the flexibility of One Key Question responses.Conclusion:One Key
   Question is an effective pregnancy intention screening tool in primary
   care settings but is limited in its capacity to reach those outside the
   health system. Community-based pregnancy intention screening offers an
   alternative avenue for implementation of One Key Question that could
   address many of these barriers and reduce disparities for underserved
   populations.},

   Aotearoa New Zealand},
Journal = {AOTEAROA NEW ZEALAND SOCIAL WORK},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4},
Pages = {151-154},
Abstract = {Although it is tempting to absolve Aotearoa New Zealand of reproductive
   injustice, conservative celebrations in response to the recent reversal
   of Roe v. Wade highlight an urgent need for abortion-focused advocacy in
   ostensibly egalitarian societies. Arguably, such advocacy could be
   catalysed within academia. Yet, navigating desires for social justice
   within disciplines that cherish apolitical science remains challenging.
   This article will unpack the aforementioned tension and discuss the
   author's experiences researching abortion attitudes and striving for
   social change in a post-Roe v. Wade Aotearoa New Zealand. A case is made
   for a divergence from objective science towards intersectional research
   and the recentring of social justice in abortion research to ensure
   gender equality in these precarious times.},

Abstract = {Sexual and reproductive health and justice (SRHJ) is key to gender
   equality and an important component of any long-term development
   strategy for countries emerging from conflict and civil war. Girls and
   women are vulnerable to various sexual and reproductive risks, which are
   exacerbated in conflict contexts and can have both short- and long-term
   economic implications for them, their families, and their communities.
   Yet neoliberalism and patriarchal power structures prevent women's
   economic well-being from being a priority when postconflict policies are
   designed. Applying a gender lens to postconflict policies, we illustrate
   why addressing reproductive justice in postconflict contexts is both a
   gender justice issue and a macroeconomic imperative, as well as
   providing concrete policy recommendations, including the imposition of a
   global arms tax, to fund postconflict SRHJ priorities. JEL

Abstract = {Most incarcerated women are of reproductive age, and more than a third
   of women will have an abortion during their reproductive years. Although
   women are the fastest growing population in Canadian prisons, no one has
   studied the effect of their incarceration on access to abortion
   services. Studies outside of Canada indicate rates of abortion are
   higher among people experiencing incarceration than in the general
   population, and that abortion access is often problematic. Although
   international standards for abortion care among incarcerated populations
   exist, there conversely appear to be no Canadian guidelines or
   procedures to facilitate unintended pregnancy prevention or management.
   Barriers to abortion care inequitably restrict people with unintended
   pregnancy from attaining education and employment opportunities, cause
   entrenchment in violent relationships, and prevent people from choosing
   to parent when they are ready and able. Understanding and facilitating
   equitable access to abortion care for incarcerated people is critical to
   address structural, gender-, and race-based reproductive health
   inequities, and to promote reproductive justice. There is an urgent need
   for research in this area to direct best practices in clinical care and
   support policies capable to ensure equal access to abortion care for
   incarcerated people.},

Abstract = {CHOICES: Memphis Center for Reproductive Health staff is passionate
   about ensuring that everyone has access to the full continuum of
   comprehensive reproductive health care (including abortion,
   gender-affirming care, miscarriage management, and community birth)
   regardless of race, gender identity, sexual orientation, HIV status,
   economic status, or religious beliefs. Memphis, Tennessee, has a history
   of limited community birth options (birthing outside of hospital walls).
   In 2017, when home birth services were added to CHOICES and plans for
   opening Memphis' first freestanding birth center were being imagined, it
   was intentional to create a model in which midwifery care could be
   accessible for patients who may be eligible for state-funded health care
   services, those considered at higher health risk than traditional
   low-risk midwifery patients, or both. In fact, individuals and their
   families with limited out-of-pocket funds and those historically
   marginalized would purposely receive holistic, individualized care based
   on their unique health care needs and personal desires, driven by a
   reproductive justice framework. In this article, we outline the success
   and challenges of addressing the reproductive health needs of
   marginalized communities, including the benefits of a nonprofit business
   model, operationalizing reproductive justice concepts, and the
   reclamation of Black midwifery. We also discuss the challenges of caring
   for Black birthing people and providing abortion and gender-affirming
   care in a politically hostile environment. Although individuals have
   complex needs, at its core, CHOICES believes that every person must be
   seen as whole human beings and that each can be cared for by a midwife.
   The CHOICES approach is informed by evidence-based information, clinical
   judgment, and an intentional partnership with and investment in a people
   who have historically been and are presently pushed to the margins,
   neglected, and blamed for poor health outcomes and demise. Striving to
   adapt the CHOICES model of care in other parts of the country is
   important now more than ever following the Supreme Court decision to
   overturn Roe v. Wade.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Roe v. Wade case, which legally supported abortion in the U.S., was
   overturned in 2022, and the international conversation about
   reproductive justice gained momentum as a result. Reproductive justice
   is a concept that advocates reproductive freedom (the freedom to
   have/not have children and the freedom to raise children in a healthy
   environment) for all couples and individuals. This paper introduces the
   family care relationship in reproductive justice and presents a concept
   of reproductive justice. By incorporating family care relationships in
   the concept of reproduction, the complexity and uniqueness of the
   reproductive choice process are preserved. Family care relationships are
   well suited for focusing on family-centered societies and the processes
   leading to abortion care, and autonomous decision-making in reproductive
   choice can be strengthened. It is important to explore appropriate
   support methods from the dynamism of the caring network, advocate for
   positive freedom, and settle the decision-making power in a moderated
   position, even with some abandonment of individualism.},

Volume = {49},

Abstract = {The field of public health law has been honing important
   transdisciplinary methods such as legal epidemiology and legal mapping.
   These methods can and should be integrated into socio-legal studies
   because they provide us with a way to capture the legal elements of
   interlocking power structures, offer ways to meaningfully compare and
   predict what access to rights will look like across jurisdictions, and
   capture a new way to study legal pluralism across and within
   jurisdictions. To illustrate the benefit of such methods for studying
   legal pluralism, this article offers the State Reproductive Autonomy
   Index, which compares all fifty states on seventy-five variables.
   Modeled on legal epidemiology's survey of multiple types of law,
   including laws that can be classified as infrastructural (laying the
   institutional or policy parameters), interventionist (specifically
   targeted to produce a result), and incidental (distally related, not
   intentionally), this method integrates the work of reproductive justice
   scholars with the work on legal pluralism to illustrate the vast
   inequalities in access to reproductive autonomy across the United
   States. The State Reproductive Autonomy Index also shows why
   reproductive justice, rather than reproductive rights discourse, is a
   more accurate frame for understanding laws relating to reproduction and
   bodily autonomy.},

Abstract = {On June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled to strike
   down Roe v. Wade (1973), a landmark decision that legalized access to
   abortion under the right to privacy. By overturning Roe, the decision
   now leaves the regulation of abortion up to each individual state.
   Consideration of the consequences that will affect vulnerable
   populations is paramount now that Roe v. Wade is overturned. Nurse
   practitioners who are impartial toward abortion should be introduced to
   Reproductive Justice, which can help them better un-derstand the lived
   experiences of people with the capacity for pregnancy and the
   complexities surrounding abortion. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Transnational solidarity and comprehensive critiques of colonial
   legacies and patriarchal systems united the cultural responses created
   during the campaigns for reproductive justice in Ireland and Chile in
   2018. This article considers the performance piece `Abortistas' by the
   Yeguada Latinoamericana in Chile and the poem `Granuaile' by Roisin
   Kelly in Ireland. Taking a decolonial feminist approach, this
   comparative study explores the interstices of art form and
   geopolitically distinct territories to examine how the creative
   practitioners' discursive construction of insurgent bodies aids critique
   of the lived experiences of women and pregnant people under the
   restrictive reproductive laws of both countries.},

Abstract = {Since 1973, the abortion debate in the United States has depended on
   contested understandings of the nation's history. More than ever,
   history went on trial in Dobbs vs. Jackson Women's Health Organization,
   the 2022 Supreme Court case that struck down Roe v. Wade, the decision
   which began to legalize abortion. After situating my own history, I
   explore the tension between legal advocacy and historical knowledge
   making, highlighting the originalism of legal argument that turns to
   outdated laws and practices to prove abortion as part of the nation's
   history, as have various historians' briefs since the late 1980s. An
   intersectional perspective grounded in Black Women's History and the
   changing lives of women offers an alternative for a broad reproductive
   justice movement.},

Abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic inaugurated a new global order of public life and
   health marked by death, despair and alienation. As a crisis of a global
   scale, it made the task of (re)imagination simultaneously necessary and
   extremely difficult. It is this double bind of the difficulty and
   imminence of imagination that motivates the curation of this special
   issue. In this introduction, we map the connections between the theme of
   this volume and the key ideas that constitute its varied contributions,
   which we organised under three broad mobilising ideas: Rights and
   Resilience; Sexuality, Health and Justice; and Politics of Knowledge
   Production and Collaborations. Contributions cover myriad issues, engage
   in methodological innovations and play with diverse genres. Alongside
   more traditional academic writings, there are community-based research
   papers, activist conversations, visual essays, reflective pieces and
   interviews. The geographical span of the contributions brings insights
   from around the world and the number of topics covered in this issue are
   equally vast including, among others, mental health, disability,
   environment, sex work, violence, queerness, LGBTQ+ experiences, love and
   anger. The aim of this special issue, then, is to challenge the
   Manichean distinctions that are often drawn between research and
   activism, and by extension, between theory and practice.},

Abstract = {The total criminalization and pervasive stigmatization of abortion in
   the Philippines constrain women's reproductive agency. Furthermore, the
   intensification of regulatory biopolitical mechanisms during the
   COVID-19 pandemic also delimits women's reproductive actions and
   decisions. Using a queer phenomenological approach drawn from Sara
   Ahmed's theorization, this study analyzes 14 abortion testimonies as
   shared by 14 women in digital spaces during the pandemic. In the
   findings, I map Filipino women's embodied encounters during abortion
   alongside a complex interplay between digital and physical spaces. Here,
   I highlight the following processes: 1) accessing the digital abortion
   marketplace, 2) queering everyday spaces into makeshift abortion places,
   3) embodying affinities in the digital abortion community, and 4)
   claiming collective resistance through abortion testimonies. This study
   discusses empirical and theoretical insights towards women's embodied
   precarities and forms of resistance during abortion and in relation to
   structural violence. I then propose future directions for abortion
   research in the Philippines, where I also aim to make practical
   contributions towards advancing reproductive justice.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the relationship between climate change and
   reproductive injustice. It does so by highlighting several ethical
   concerns that warrant public policy attention at the intersection of
   full bodily autonomy and the transition to a carbon neutral economy. In
   Section one, the climate change science literature addressing the health
   and social harm disparities for low-income communities is summarized.
   This summary emphasizes the effects of this harm for poor women and
   girls of color. In Section two, the jurisprudential history regarding
   full bodily autonomy and reproductive justice is presented. This
   recounting draws attention to the historical legacy of inequality based
   on race, gender, and class. In Section three, the ethical implications
   of climate change are presented and discussed through the analytical
   lens of green criminology and reproductive justice. These implications
   include a feminist reclaiming of full bodily autonomy for poor women and
   girls of color, given the health and social inequalities they
   disproportionately experience.},

Abstract = {The intrauterine device (IUD) as a long-acting reversible contraceptive
   technology is increasingly being marketed to younger women for whom
   hormonal therapies are deemed problematic. Focusing on the American
   College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) training materials for
   clinicians, we examine the biopolitics of reproductive counseling for
   the IUD among this population. Specifically, we interrogate how American
   clinicians are trained to engage young patients in the coproduction of
   reproductive biographies to determine their suitability for the IUD.
   Ostensibly recognizing the importance women's autonomy to reproductive
   justice, ACOG stresses the importance of `shared decision-making'.
   However, we argue that ACOG's approach to shared decision-making still
   enrolls patients in processes that delineate forms to reproductive
   differences to be controlled. Specifically, obstetricians and
   gynecologists are instructed to categorize certain reproductive bodies
   as risky, differentiating them from those classified as timely and
   responsible. These categories, underpinned by constructions of normative
   readiness, reproduce forms of `colorblind' difference under the rubric
   of reproductive risk. Our findings suggest clinicians are still trained
   to employ a gynecological gaze that differentiates patient populations
   based on perceived reproductive responsibility. Thus, we argue that
   beneath the surface of collaborative reproductive counseling, the
   gynecological gaze continues to differentiate treatment for those bodies
   classified as irresponsible. Our analysis highlights the enduring power
   relations that link the production of reproductive health knowledge and
   deeply gendered and implicitly racialized systems of categorizing
   populations.},

Abstract = {Birth control has long been considered an essential part of postpartum
   rounds. Many health care providers believe prevention of pregnancy is a
   priority in the postpartum period and that the inpatient postpartum stay
   is an ideal time to discuss contraception. This belief is not
   necessarily shared by birthing people. Many patients are unready to talk
   about contraception hours after birth, and contraceptive counseling may
   feel punitive for people whose reproduction has been marginalized.
   Health care providers must acknowledge this harmful and racist history
   to change counseling practices actively and thoughtfully to best meet
   patient needs while simultaneously respecting patient autonomy.},

Title = {Restrictive State Abortion Bans-A Reproductive Injustice},
Journal = {OBSTETRICAL \& GYNECOLOGICAL SURVEY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {77},
Number = {9},
Pages = {515-517},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In this perspective, the authors call on the medical community to come
   together to preserve reproductive rights in light of the challenge to
   Roe v Wade and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v Casey,
   both of which permit abortion before fetal viability under the
   constitutional right to privacy since 1973. (This perspective was
   written before the US Supreme Court's official decision to uphold Dobbs
   v Jackson Women's Health Organization, making the procedure illegal in
   more than 20 states.)
   While some medical professionals have deeply held beliefs around
   abortion, many are ambivalent or agnostic, believing that the issue does
   not affect their specialties or patients. The authors contend that
   continuing to ensure the legal right to safe abortion is relevant to all
   specialties and their patients, family members, and communities.
   The authors write that safe, affordable, and accessible abortion
   services are critical to reproductive justice. Limiting abortion
   resources undermines bodily autonomy and contributes to unintended
   pregnancy. They write that laws that restrict abortion access through
   arbitrary gestational-age cutoffs or burdensome waiting periods narrow
   the options for populations that already have poor access to health care
   and exacerbate reproductive inequities based on race, ethnic group, and
   socioeconomic status.
   The authors assert that the arguments made by Mississippi's solicitor
   general in the Dobbs case to ban nearly all abortions after 15 weeks of
   gestation show a lack of empathy for those considering the option of
   abortion and a lack of trust in individuals to make fundamental
   decisions on whether to have a child. The state argued that the burden
   of parenting could be mitigated by adoption and baby safe havens. The
   authors believe that this argument disregards the social, emotional, and
   economic impact associated with pregnancy, giving birth, and
   surrendering a child. The argument also perpetuates disinformation that
   abortion carries a medical risk equal to that of pregnancy and
   childbirth, whereas mortality due to childbirth in the United States is
   14 times as high as the mortality rate due to abortion.
   The state also argued that the availability and affordability of
   contraception have changed the need for abortion. The authors contend
   that this argument suggests that cost is a factor in exercising legal
   rights and distracts from deeper considerations to promote reproductive
   well-being at the state or societal level. The authors also write that
   all birth control methods hold the risk of failure, even when used
   correctly, and under no other circumstances is it unlawful to provide
   treatment when preventive-medicine regimens fail.
   The authors acknowledge that moral considerations, such as fetal
   viability thresholds, are a more nuanced issue. The authors believe that
   the precedence of Roe to protect the right to abortion until the point
   of fetal viability creates a balancesupporting abortion access while
   acknowledging this nuance. It is not a legislative line, and
   Mississippi's threshold of 15 weeks of gestation does not confer
   viability.
   The authors write that ``the gravity of this moment cannot be
   overstated: the aspirations of the United States to be an equitable and
   just society are, in all likelihood, about to receive another blow.{''}},

Title = {Reforming Medicaid Coverage Toward Reproductive Justice},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF LAW \& MEDICINE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {48},
Number = {2-3},
Pages = {223-243},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {As the United States' largest public health insurance program, Medicaid
   has since 1965 played a crucial role in the struggle for equitable
   health care access. It has the potential to be a powerful instrument of
   reproductive justice, yet discriminatory policies that deny coverage for
   vital sexual, reproductive, or other health services, or exclude entire
   populations of people with low incomes from coverage altogether,
   constrain peoples' health and reproductive futures. Resulting
   discrimination in Medicaid law and policy thwart the program's ability
   to promote intergenerational health equity and reproductive justice for
   underserved communities.This Article provides an account of why
   reproductive justice is a necessary framework for examining,
   reimagining, and reforming Medicaid coverage law and policy. Part I
   gives a brief history and overview of reproductive justice, which serves
   as ``an open source code that people have used to pursue fresh critical
   thinking regarding power and powerlessness. `` Part II argues that we
   should utilize that open source code in Medicaid coverage reform. Using
   some of the reproductive justice movement's critiques as a starting
   point, it explores how reproductive oppression has shaped Medicaid
   coverage law, policy, and mainstream reproductive and health care reform
   movements' proposals, and to what effect. It argues that examining
   Medicaid law, policy, and proposed reforms through this lens and in
   collaboration with the reproductive justice movement can enable health
   advocates and policymakers to more fully understand, disrupt, and
   dismantle reproductive injustices that drive health inequities.
   Ultimately, it can empower reformers to build a more equitable public
   health insurance safety net that brings us closer to reproductive
   justice for all.},

Abstract = {Lactation is a powerful tool for improving health trajectories and
   promoting reproductive justice. Multiple new human milk-expression
   technologies are available. Although direct feeding is optimal and
   feasible in many circumstances, understanding human milk-expression
   technology and counseling patients appropriately represents one of the
   ways physicians can support patients in meeting their feeding goals.
   Breast pumps and breast pump accessories may help patients establish and
   maintain breastfeeding, but these technologies continue to evolve and
   are not always intuitive. The core components of a pump are the
   attachment at the breast, valves, tubing, motor, device programming, and
   reservoir. Whereas closed systems can be used by multiple patients, open
   systems are single-user and they are not able to be sterilized. Mobile
   pumps may help support breastfeeding individuals who are unable to
   remain stationary for the time necessary to express milk. Nonelectric
   pumps represent an important adjuvant technology. There are a wide
   variety of pump accessories that may help patients overcome specific
   breastfeeding challenges. Obstetricians remain uniquely positioned to
   support patients in achieving their lactation goals, which is enhanced
   by familiarity with the supportive technologies available.},

   SIECUS: Sex Ed for Social Change (SIECUS). This document identifies the
   foundations of sex education in the United States. It recognizes the

   and fear-based sex education. SIECUS utilizes this publication to
   explore the organization's history and its impact on the progress of sex
   education. Still, this history is missing recounts of the intersection
   of gender, race, and sex, including reproductive justice and notable
   organizations, works, and people.},

Title = {Obtaining buy-in for immediate postpartum long-acting reversible
   contraception programs in Texas hospitals: A qualitative study},
Journal = {CONTRACEPTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {108},
Pages = {32-36},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Objective: To understand the specific ways in which champions lead
   efforts to obtain and sustain buy-in for immediate postpartum
   long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) programs.
   Methods: We conducted a qualitative study with 60 semistructured
   interviews at 3 teaching hospitals in Texas with physicians, nurses,
   administrators and other staffwho participated in the implementation of
   immediate postpartum LARC. Physicians self-identified as champions and
   identified other champion physicians and administrators. Two researchers
   analyzed and coded interview transcripts for content and themes.
   Results: We found that champions draw on institutional knowledge and
   relationships to build awareness and support for immediate postpartum
   LARC implementation. To obtain buy-in, champions needed to demonstrate
   financial sustainability, engage key stakeholders from multiple
   departments, and obtain nurse buy-in. Champions also created buy-in by
   communicating goals for the service that focused on expanding
   reproductive autonomy, improving maternal health, and improving access
   to postpartum contraception. Some staff, especially nurses, identified
   reasons for the program that run counter to reproductive justice
   principles: reducing birth rates, poverty, and/or unplanned pregnancy
   among young women and high-parity women. Respondents at 2 hospitals
   noted that not all women had equitable access to immediate postpartum
   LARC.
   Conclusion: Physician and non-physician champions must secure long-term
   support across multiple hospital departments to successfully implement
   an immediate postpartum LARC program. For programs to equitably serve
   all women in need of postpartum contraceptive care, champions and other
   program leaders need to implement strategies to address access issues.
   They should also explicitly focus on reproductive justice principles
   during program introduction and training. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {This paper examines a badly understudied topic, the feminist lead-ership
   provided by southern women in the Department of Chris-tian Social
   Relations, a subunit of the Woman's Society of Christian Service (WSCS),
   and the United Methodist Women (UMW) from 1940 to 1990. It examines the
   origins and influence of the powerful UMW and its predecessor
   organizations, and explains why south-ern women predominated in
   leadership and why southerners, who are usually understood to be forces
   of conservatism, led the church to adopt progressive positions and
   policies regarding racial and gender justice in the mid-to late
   twentieth century. Profiled are the three most influential women within
   the UMW and its prede- cessors: Thelma Stevens, Peggy Billings, and
   Theressa Hoover. It briefly describes the effect that the Religious
   Right had on progres- sive women, and concludes with a brief discussion
   of the current debate over human sexuality within Methodism.},

Title = {US Black Maternal Health Advocacy Topics and Trends on Twitter: Temporal
   Infoveillance Study},
Journal = {JMIR INFODEMIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN-JUN},
Abstract = {Background: Black women in the United States disproportionately suffer
   adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes compared to White women. Economic
   adversity and implicit bias during clinical encounters may lead to
   physiological responses that place Black women at higher risk for
   adverse birth outcomes. The novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19)
   further exacerbated this risk, as safety protocols increased social
   isolation in clinical settings, thereby limiting opportunities to
   advocate for unbiased care. Twitter, 1 of the most popular social
   networking sites, has been used to study a variety of issues of public
   interest, including health care. This study considers whether posts on
   Twitter accurately reflect public discourse during the COVID-19 pandemic
   and are being used in infodemiology studies by public health
   experts.Objective: This study aims to assess the feasibility of Twitter
   for identifying public discourse related to social determinants of
   health and advocacy that influence maternal health among Black women
   across the United States and to examine trends in sentiment between 2019
   and 2020 in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods: Tweets were
   collected from March 1 to July 13, 2020, from 21 organizations and
   influencers and from 4 hashtags that focused on Black maternal health.
   Additionally, tweets from the same organizations and hashtags were
   collected from the year prior, from March 1 to July 13, 2019. Twint, a
   Python programming library, was used for data collection and analysis.
   We gathered the text of approximately 17,000 tweets, as well as all
   publicly available metadata. Topic modeling and k-means clustering were
   used to analyze the tweets.Results: A variety of trends were observed
   when comparing the 2020 data set to the 2019 data set from the same
   period. The percentages listed for each topic are probabilities of that
   topic occurring in our corpus. In our topic models, tweets on
   reproductive justice, maternal mortality crises, and patient care
   increased by 67.46\% in 2020 versus 2019. Topics on community, advocacy,
   and health equity increased by over 30\% in 2020 versus 2019. In
   contrast, tweet topics that decreased in 2020 versus 2019 were as
   follows: tweets on Medicaid and medical coverage decreased by 27.73\%,
   and discussions about creating space for Black women decreased by just
   under 30\%.Conclusions: The results indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic
   may have spurred an increased focus on advocating for improved
   reproductive health and maternal health outcomes among Black women in
   the United States. Further analyses are needed to capture a longer time
   frame that encompasses more of the pandemic, as well as more diverse
   voices to confirm the robustness of the findings. We also concluded that
   Twitter is an effective source for providing a snapshot of relevant
   topics to guide Black maternal health advocacy efforts.},

   Academia},
Journal = {WOMENS HEALTH REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Pages = {131-143},
Abstract = {Objective: To assess the accessibility of abortion providers across
   collegiate campuses in the State of Colorado.
   Participants: Analysis was on secondary data from the Integrated
   Postsecondary Data System and the U.S. Census Bureau.
   Methods: We utilized a framework of Reproductive Justice to assess and
   interpret the accessibility of abortion providers to college students by
   mapping reproductive health centers and nonprofit institutions of higher
   education, then using these data to statistically compare racial
   demographics, female employment, and insurance coverage between
   institutions with and without access.
   Results: Of nonprofit postsecondary institutions in Colorado, 11
   institutions lack access, serving similar to 38,900 students. Of these
   students, 88.7\% attend a Minority Serving Institution (MSI). MS's
   lacking abortion access had 8\% more female enrollment {[}t(18.32)=
   -2.04, p=0.027]. Campuses possessing student health centers are less
   likely to have an MSI designation (50\% with vs. 82\% without), have
   greater female Hispanic enrollment by 10\% {[}t(23.72)=3.11, p= 0.005]
   and lower female multiracial enrollment by 2\% {[}t(37.00)=2.20, p=
   0.034]. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) results indicated significant
   differences in percent composition of Asian, black or African American,
   Two or More, and Nonresident demographics between collegiate campuses
   with 30-, 45-, and 60-minute drive-time access. ANOVA results indicated
   separate patterns of differences for Zip Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA)
   demographics for Asian, black or African American, Native Hawaiian or
   Pacific Islander, Other Race, and Nonresident populations. Planned
   contrasts demonstrated that this difference was greatest at the
   30-minute drive-time access, supporting the use of 30-minute drive time
   as an important indicator of access.
   Conclusions: The colleges lacking access to a provider are predominantly
   MSIs in lower income communities. The patterns in campus and ZCTA
   demographics indicate that collegiate populations are affected by
   rurality differently than the general population. We recommend that
   future qualitative research to assess rural students' perceptions on
   access, campus health center practices, and practices on campuses
   without dedicated health facilities.},

Abstract = {People with intellectual disabilities face difficulties in realising
   their reproductive rights in different countries and may face challenges
   to their parental rights in child protection systems. Some studies have
   explored how parents with intellectual disabilities became involved in
   their parenting roles, the barriers faced, their needs and types of
   support they received, the developmental outcome for their children, and
   further research has evaluated supporting interventions. However, these
   studies were primarily generated in high-income countries, likely due to
   the social development of these countries and affected by how people
   with intellectual disabilities are perceived by each society. Assuredly,
   this issue needs to be explored in other cultural contexts because
   previous studies have shown that gender, traditional beliefs, family
   structure, and religious beliefs all affect the experience of parenting
   with disabilities. In this article, we first focus on reproductive
   justice and the rights of parents with intellectual disabilities.
   Secondly, we explain current reproduction-related demographic data and
   studies of people with intellectual disabilities in Taiwan. Finally, we
   discuss reproductive justice and its contributions to social work in
   Taiwan.},

Abstract = {From Gattaca to Star Trek. problematic tropes surrounding reproduction
   can easily be found in works of mainstream science fiction. Such tropes
   uphold conservative anxieties around reproductive technologies,
   abortion, and pregnancy, and these works thus become influential in
   legal, ethical, and policy discussions on these issues. In contrast,
   feminist science fiction attempts to expose reproductive injustice, both
   current and future, through portrayals of prototype social-legal
   contexts. In this article, I argue that feminist science fiction works
   are, therefore, of importance for feminist legal theory as they can help
   us imagine a radically transformed future for reproduction. I consider
   the work of Octavia Butler and Laura Lam as examples of reproductive
   dystopia highlighting current, past, and potential future socio-legal
   injustices. These feminist works call for change grounded in the lived
   experiences of women and people capable of becoming pregnant.},

Abstract = {A reproductive justice reading of Numbers 5:11-31 centers on ``the human
   right to maintain personal bodily autonomy, have children, not have
   children, and parent the children we have in safe and sustainable
   communities,{''} as the SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice
   Collective stated so lucidly twenty years ago. Accordingly, a
   reproductive justice interpretation stresses the ethical imperative of
   reading Numbers 5:11-31 within the context of the reproductive justice
   movement. The interpretation centers on the most marginalized
   character-the woman-by recasting the woman's experience as sexual
   violence and not as adultery; it addresses the intersecting oppression
   as it is represented by the husband whose ally is the priest; it
   analyzes the depicted power system in Numbers 5:11-31; and it reimagines
   the dusty water drink as an herbal abortifacient.},

Abstract = {Midwifery care is a safe and cost-effective care model; producing
   excellent outcomes especially for vulnerable and isolated people due to
   its one-on-one continuity of care and family -centered model. Recent
   research studies have shown out of hospital birth to have numerous
   benefits; shorter labors and lower rates of interventions, without an
   increase in adverse outcomes. These outcomes are more reliable when
   midwifery care is fully supported and integrated into existing maternity
   care systems. There are significant barriers to the provision of
   equitable reproductive health care to pregnant and birthing people in
   rural and remote areas. This, in the context of the United States being
   the only country where maternal mortality rates are on the rise.
   Midwifery care has been proposed as a potential solution but the need
   for working models of such care exists. The article showcases a working
   and replicable midwifery care practice model; showing how it can
   function to address inequity by building collaborative partnerships with
   other providers to advocate on clients' behalf and reduce vulnerability
   to health disparities. This has practice implications for maternity
   providers and policy makers, introducing how advocacy can help remove
   the systemic barriers affecting reproductive justice and care.

Title = {<i>Saving Delaney</i> ... by white privilege: a memoir of lesbian
   motherhood and anti-Black ableism},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF LESBIAN STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {258-273},
Abstract = {Saving Delaney is one of a number of ``special needs{''} parent memoirs
   published in the United States since 2000 and is the only memoir about
   raising a disabled child in the United States written by lesbian
   parents. Like many representations of disability, ``special needs{''}
   parent memoirs use a problematic narrative in which the presumed
   negative effects of disability are individually overcome before life
   lived happily ever after. Also like popular and positive representations
   of disability, the children subjects of ``special needs{''} parent
   memoirs are almost entirely white. In this paper, I contextualize Saving
   Delaney within histories of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender
   (LGBT) family-making in the United States, drawing particular attention
   to the overrepresentation of children with disabilities among gay and
   lesbian adoptive parent households. Then, drawing attention to the
   overwhelming whiteness of both positive portrayals of children with
   disabilities in ``special needs{''} parent memoirs and LGBT families in
   scholarship, data, and media, I argue that white privilege facilitates
   visibility and protection against disability stigmas. I demonstrate that
   LGBT family-making and caring for children with disabilities cohere as
   issues of comprehensive reproductive justice and that narratives like
   Delaney's fail to advance the reproductive justice movement due to
   reiterative entrenchment in the material and discursive privileges of
   whiteness.},

Abstract = {This essay examines the role of artificial insemination by frozen sperm
   and the role of the commercial sperm bank in two black feminist novels,
   Fran Ross's Oreo (1974) and Ntozake Shange's Sassafrass, Cypress and
   Indigo (1982), through an analysis of their engagement with speculative
   structures such as dream sequences. Oreo and Sassafrass, Cypress and
   Indigo were published in a social and political moment characterized by
   the antiracist activism of black power and black nationalism and by the
   gender activism of women's liberation. Ross and Shange outline a black
   feminist theory of reproductive science cognizant of the history of
   black women's reproductive exploitation, directly responding to the
   social movements of the 1970s that elided the specific concerns of black
   women. The novels demonstrate how the not-so-distant past of American
   slavery and the imagined near future of technologically liberated
   reproduction collide in the present. This essay reveals the theories of
   reproductive justice embedded in these novels and contextualizes their
   critiques within the contemporary fertility market.},

Abstract = {Australia has seen a number of efforts at reform of abortion laws in
   recent years. Some jurisdictions have decriminalised abortion entirely,
   and other states have made efforts to reform abortion law without
   complete decriminalisation. At the other end of the spectrum, Queensland
   in 2018 listed abortion as a criminal offence. This article uses the
   framework of questions in the Queensland Law Reform Commission
   consultation paper to reprise the need for abortion law reform in
   Queensland specifically, and Australia generally. While answering the
   Queensland Law Reform Commission questions, we frame our inquiry around
   empowering women's self-determination to make decisions about their
   reproductive health as a hallmark of their equality as citizens.},

Abstract = {In this piece, Lindquist provides a toolkit for working with Indigenous
   youth through media arts. In doing so, she braids the three themes of
   the Symposium together: Indigenous, digital, and youth issues. Here, she
   presents her work as part academic article, part toolkit. The toolkit
   includes four examples of media arts justice activities that can be used
   to engage and support youth as they make connections between local and
   global issues. These activities were used by nehiyaw youth from Frog
   Lake First Nation who were attending Heinsburg Community School with
   support from Native Youth Sexual Health Network. Each activity includes
   a step-by-step guide, as well as background information on the relevance
   for young people as well as the scholarly community. They are grounded
   in both project-and place-based pedagogical approaches, and have
   benefits for Indigenous and non-Indigenous students. Lindquist theorizes
   around these examples throughout using Indigenous feminisms,
   reproductive justice, and education-based frameworks and thus bridges
   the gap between scholar and practitioner. This toolkit is emerging as a
   bridge between where we are at now and what we can imagine.},

Abstract = {In this article, I draw together feminist research on the distinct areas
   of assisted human reproduction (or new reproductive technology) and
   post-constructionist theory to examine some common methodological and
   epistemological issues fundamental for reproductive justice. I revisit
   the notion of technologically-assisted (reproductive) disembodiment (e.
   g., in vitro fertilization, surrogacy and egg donation) in light of
   theoretical developments in feminism, in particular
   post-constructionism. Specifically, I ask what light is shed on the
   paradox of reproduction (in particular disembodied reproduction) by
   feminist post-constructionism?},

   request it arrived just as the last issue was going to press, and didn't
   fit anyway with the theme of that issue. It's a little better fit with
   the Interfaith focus of this issue, and in any case, through his
   ceaseless activism on behalf of Reproductive Justice and a wide range of
   other Humanist concerns, Edd has earned the right to have his suggestion
   that ``this belongs in RH,{''} taken seriously.
   In 1981 humanist leaders Edward Ericson and the late Sherwin Wine
   founded Americans for Religious Liberty. In 1982 I was asked to be ARL's
   executive director. ARL's positions match those of the UUA resolution.},

Journal = {ASTROLABIO-NUEVA EPOCA},
Year = {2013},

Pages = {123-159},
Abstract = {This paper examines the intersectional, coalition politics forged by
   activists in US environmental justice and women's rights organisations.
   This coalitional politics articulates environmental and feminist
   concerns and rejects the limitations of a narrow-focused politics in
   favour of a more strategic, relational vision of social and
   environmental change. Framed by the Marxist-feminist concept of ``social
   reproduction{''}, the analysis addresses the complex ways that
   globalised capitalism has transformed state and corporate
   responsibilities for social reproduction. The neoliberal policies of
   privatisation and deregulation have eroded the assurance of a liveable
   wage, affordable healthcare, decent education, breathable air, and clean
   water. Drawing on several examples from grassroots movements and
   community-based organisations, the essay discusses how diverse women
   activists conceptually link environmental justice and reproductive
   rights issues in their communities' struggles to sustain everyday life
   (or, to accomplish ``social reproduction{''}). The innovative coalition
   politics of organisations such as Asian Communities for Reproductive
   Justice and the Environmental Justice and Climate Change Coalition are
   generating dynamic ``living environmentalisms{''} with enough political
   vision and community ``groundedness{''} to build broadly-based
   social-environmental collaborations that stand a chance at compelling
   people to take stronger action to curb problems as big as global
   warming.},
