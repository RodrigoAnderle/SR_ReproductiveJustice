Nevertheless, to date, there has been no investigation into how Chilean midwives have incorporated induced abortion care provision into their professional identity. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate how Chilean midwives understand and provide abortion care and how they have (re)defined their professional identity to include induced abortion care. This article reports the findings of the second part of this aim. METHODS: This study was underpinned by a constructivist grounded theory methodology informed by a reproductive justice and feminist perspective. Midwives from Chile who have cared for women undergoing abortion were invited to participate in the study. After purposive and theoretical sampling, fifteen midwives were recruited. FINDINGS: Midwives' identity is woman-centred, with high value placed on their role protecting life. These two aspects of midwives' identity are in contradiction when providing abortion care. Midwives' identity results from and informs midwives' practice. Midwifery regulation influences both practice and identity. The model 'Navigating a maze' explains the interaction of these three elements. CONCLUSION: Midwives' identity response to the enactment of the Chilean abortion law is an example of how professional identity must navigate regulation and practice to make sense of its purpose. In light of this study's findings, the current tension experienced in midwives' identity should be carefully attended to prevent adverse outcomes for midwives and the Chilean population.",20240203,131,,10.1016/j.midw.2024.103938,1532-3099,,

DESIGN: Qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews with Roma women ages 18 through 67 in different neighborhoods in the southeast of Spain. Using a thematic analysis, we analyzed experiences related to menarche and menstruation and their significance for reproductive health, the preparation for the phase of menarche and intergenerational support. RESULTS: The Roma women interviewed shared their approach to the experiences of menarche and menstruation as children in their family environments with a focus on access to information provided by other women in the family and community for reproductive health management. In their discourses we observed that the onset of menstruation supposes a rupture in the public and private spaces of girls and women. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that women and girls do not gain access to information that contributes to their reproductive wellbeing through their experience of menarche. Access to resources and skills to manage biological changes in adolescents could contribute to reducing the impact of cultural myths, false ideas and taboos that prevent advocacy and empowerment on issues of reproductive justice.",20240202,21,1,10.1186/s12978-023-01726-5,1742-4755,,

At the same time, this therapeutic option is enormously complex when considered from a historical, sociological, or ethical perspective. This Committee Statement reviews ethical issues related to permanent contraception using a reproductive justice framework. Ethical counseling and shared decision making for permanent contraception should adopt a nonjudgmental, patient-centered approach, using up-to-date information about permanent contraception procedures and alternatives. Obstetrician-gynecologists should strive to avoid bringing into the clinical encounter biases around gender, race, age, and class that affect thoughts on who should or should not become a parent. Obstetrician-gynecologists should also ensure that permanent contraception requests reflect each patient's wishes, come from a desire to permanently end childbearing, and come from a preference for permanent contraception over all reversible methods as well as permanent contraception for the male partner. When difficulties in meeting a postpartum permanent contraception request are anticipated and permanent contraception is desired by the patient, transfer of care for the remainder of pregnancy should be offered. ACOG recognizes the right of all patients to unimpeded access to permanent contraception as a way of ensuring health equity, but it is unclear how to craft policies that protect from coercion but also do not create barriers to autonomously desired care. Determining the ethical balance between access and safeguards will require a collaborative interdisciplinary approach that involves a variety of stakeholders with varying perspectives.",20240118,143,2,10.1097/AOG.0000000000005474,1873-233X,,

Emerging research suggests that disrespectful care during childbirth contributes to this problem. PURPOSE: To conduct a systematic review on definitions and valid measurements of respectful maternity care (RMC), its effectiveness for improving maternal and infant health outcomes for those who are pregnant and postpartum, and strategies for implementation. DATA SOURCES: Systematic searches of Ovid Medline, CINAHL, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycInfo, and SocINDEX for English-language studies (inception to July 2023). STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized studies of interventions of RMC versus usual care for effectiveness studies; additional qualitative and noncomparative validation studies for definitions and measurement studies. DATA EXTRACTION: Dual data abstraction and quality assessment using established methods, with resolution of disagreements through consensus. DATA SYNTHESIS: Thirty-seven studies were included across all questions, of which 1 provided insufficient evidence on the effectiveness of RMC to improve maternal outcomes and none studied RMC to improve infant outcomes. To define RMC, authors identified 12 RMC frameworks, from which 2 main concepts were identified: disrespect and abuse and rights-based frameworks. Disrespect and abuse components focused on recognizing birth mistreatment; rights-based frameworks incorporated aspects of reproductive justice, human rights, and antiracism. Five overlapping framework themes include freedom from abuse, consent, privacy, dignity, communication, safety, and justice. Twelve tools to measure RMC were validated in 24 studies on content validity, construct validity, and internal consistency, but lack of a gold standard limited evaluation of criterion validity. Three tools specific for RMC had at least 1 study demonstrating consistency internally and with an intended construct relevant to U.S. settings, but no single tool stands out as the best measure of RMC. LIMITATIONS: No studies evaluated other health outcomes or RMC implementation strategies. The lack of definition and gold standard limit evaluation of RMC tools. CONCLUSION: Frameworks for RMC are well described but vary in their definitions. Tools to measure RMC demonstrate consistency but lack a gold standard, requiring further evaluation before implementation in U.S. settings. Evidence is lacking on the effectiveness of implementing RMC to improve any maternal or infant health outcome. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

Given that improving maternal health and access to reproductive health care are key targets underpinning the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), there is an urgent need to improve access to appropriate supports and services for this population. Little is known about what programs and practices exist to support PPWUD's access to sexual and reproductive health care. This scoping review aimed to identify the available literature on these programs and practices in Canada. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted using JBI methodology and reported using PRISMA guidelines. Scholarly databases and grey literature sources were searched to identify literature published between 2016-2023 in English or French that discussed, defined, conceptualised, or evaluated programs and practices that support PPWUD's access to sexual and reproductive health care in Canada. Identified literature was screened using Covidence. Data were extracted from included texts, then analysed descriptively. Frequencies and key concepts were reported. RESULTS: A total of 71 articles were included, most of which were grey literature. Of the total, 46 unique programs were identified, as well as several useful practices. Most programs were in urban centres in Western Canada, and most programs offered holistic 'wrap-around services.' Several programs delivered these services on-site or as 'drop-in' programs with the support of staff with lived/living experience of substance use. Most frequent program outcomes included keeping parents and children together, improving connection to other services, and reducing substance use harms. Noted helpful practices included non-judgmental care and the use of harm-reduction strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Several programs and practices that support PPWUD exist in Canada, though few focus exclusively on sexual and reproductive health. There remain opportunities to improve access to programs, including expanding geographic availability and range of services. The review has clinical application by providing an overview of available programs that may support clinicians in identifying services for PPWUD. Future research should consider client perspectives and experiences of these programs.

There is currently a dearth of research on the continuity of midwifery care from initiation of prenatal care through birth in relation to characteristics such as race/ethnicity and income. The aim of this study was to investigate whether race/ethnicity and insurance status were associated with the likelihood of a pregnant person who begins prenatal care with a midwife to remain in midwifery care for birth attendance. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of a diverse population of pregnant patients who gave birth in a large tertiary care hospital and had their first prenatal visit with a certified nurse-midwife (CNM) between June 2, 2009, and June 30, 2020 (n = 5121). We used multivariable, log-binomial regression models to calculate risk ratios of transferring to physician care (vs remaining within CNM care), adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, prepregnancy body mass index, insurance type, and comorbidities. RESULTS: After adjusting for pregnancy-related risk factors, non-Hispanic Black patients (adjusted relative risk [aRR], 1.14; 95% CI, 1.04-1.24) and publicly insured patients (aRR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01-1.22) were at higher risk of being transferred to physician care compared with non-Hispanic White and privately insured patients. Secondary analysis revealed that non-Hispanic Black patients had higher risk of transferring and having an operative birth (aRR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.18-1.55), whereas publicly insured patients were at higher risk of being transferred for reasons other than operative births (aRR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.18-1.54). DISCUSSION: These findings indicate that Black and publicly insured patients were more likely than White and privately insured patients to transfer to physician care even after adjustment for comorbid conditions. Thus, further research is needed to identify the factors that contribute to racial and economic disparity in continuity of midwifery care.",20240106,69,4,10.1111/jmwh.13604,1542-2011,,

Communication deficits contribute to negative birth experiences. This qualitative analysis explored themes related to communication and negative birth experiences among Black birthing people who experienced preterm birth. METHODS: We conducted qualitative interviews with non-Hispanic Black, English language-proficient birthing people with Medicaid-insured preterm infants. Interviews were designed to explore experiences with health care access and well-being after birth. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and coded following an integrated approach where we applied a priori codes and captured emergent themes from the data. RESULTS: We interviewed 30 participants from October 2018 to July 2021. Median gestational age at birth was 30 weeks (range 22-36 weeks). Interviews occurred a median of 7 months postpartum (range 2-34 months). Themes emerged related to negative birth experiences and communication: (1) communication gaps during urgent or emergent intrapartum procedures contributed to negative birth experiences; (2) postpartum opportunities to share birth experiences, particularly with peers, sometimes mitigated the psychological consequences of negative birth experiences; (3) participants did not consistently discuss concerns about future pregnancy risk related to negative birth experiences with clinical teams. CONCLUSIONS: Themes from this sample of Black birthing people who experienced preterm birth suggest 3 ways health systems might intervene to improve communication to mitigate the consequences of negative birth experiences.

Illinois Contraceptive Access Now (ICAN!) is an initiative addressing the access gap to high-quality contraceptive care with a focus on normalizing reproductive health screening for patients in federally qualified community health centers (FQHCs). STUDY DESIGN: This multi-method program evaluation used the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework, with retrospective and prospective data collection from three Illinois FQHCs who participated as Quality Hubs, and from a Community Advisory Board. We conducted descriptive analysis of patient surveys using the Person-Centered Contraceptive Counseling (PCCC) measure (n = 142); clinician and staff pre-and post-training surveys (n = 210); and Community Advisory Board surveys (n = 8) collecting quantitative and qualitative feedback. We ran logistic regression on claims data from 15- to 49-year-old patients identified as female at birth (n = 103,756). RESULTS: Reach assessment showed patients receiving contraceptive or preconception care increased from 1063 per month in 2020 to 1236 per month in 2021 (16% increase), while general volume increased 2%. Effectiveness showed most patients (78%) described the quality of contraceptive counseling as ""excellent"" on the PCCC. Adoption assessment showed knowledge increases after clinical training on Modern Contraception (85% pre-training, 95% post-training) and Reproductive Justice (RJ) (58% pre-training, 70% post-training). Implementation assessment found that most Community Advisory Board members felt ICAN! was responsive to community needs. CONCLUSIONS: The ICAN! demonstration year increased provider knowledge and volume of reproductive care at three Illinois FQHCs. IMPLICATIONS: Contraceptive access initiatives that operationalize same day access to birth control methods while training FQHC providers on RJ and modern contraception, show promise on several measures. Early evidence from ICAN! indicates increased reproductive health service provision, as well as increases in provider knowledge of RJ and modern contraceptive care.",20231008,129,,10.1016/j.contraception.2023.110305,1879-0518,,

In the context of clinical care, language has power and meaning and reflects priorities, beliefs, values, and culture. Stigmatizing language can communicate unintended meanings that perpetuate socially constructed power dynamics and result in bias. This bias may harm pregnant and birthing people by centering positions of power and privilege and by reflecting cultural priorities in the United States, including judgments of demographic and reproductive health characteristics. This commentary builds on relationship-centered care and reproductive justice frameworks to analyze the role and use of language in pregnancy and birth care in the United States, particularly regarding people with marginalized identities. We describe the use of language in written documentation, verbal communication, and behaviors associated with caring for pregnant people. We also present recommendations for change, including alternative language at the individual, clinician, hospital, health systems, and policy levels. We define birth as the emergence of a new individual from the body of its parent, no matter what intervention or pathology may be involved. Thus, we propose a cultural shift in hospital-based care for birthing people that centers the birthing person and reconceptualizes all births as physiologic events, approached with a spirit of care, partnership, and support.",20230907,142,4,10.1097/AOG.0000000000005333,1873-233X,,

Lisu, who endured these procedures, struggle with strength loss, nervousness, and pain. Government discourses diminish the Lisu experience, arguing that the policy was lenient toward them. Lisu themselves are reticent to share their experiences but have devised new practices to care for those affected. Drawing on long-term ethnographic fieldwork, I argue that these chronic illnesses and accompanying care practices constitute everyday forms of remembering through which Lisu give shape to their experiences of cultural loss under Chinese colonization while generating new social relationships.

Recent evidence also supports a systemic inflammatory component that underlies associated co-morbidities, e.g., migraines and cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases. Genetics and environment contribute significantly to disease risk, and with the explosion of omics technologies, underlying mechanisms of symptoms are increasingly being elucidated, although novel and effective therapeutics for pain and infertility have lagged behind these advances. Moreover, there are stark disparities in diagnosis, access to care, and treatment among persons of color and transgender/nonbinary identity, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, and adolescents, and a disturbing low awareness among health care providers, policymakers, and the lay public about endometriosis, which, if left undiagnosed and under-treated can lead to significant fibrosis, infertility, depression, and markedly diminished quality of life. This review summarizes endometriosis epidemiology, compelling evidence for its pathogenesis, mechanisms underlying its pathophysiology in the age of precision medicine, recent biomarker discovery, novel therapeutic approaches, and issues around reproductive justice for marginalized populations with this disorder spanning the past 100 years.

These propositions are fleshed out with reference to an ethnography of pregnancy care in Switzerland. The results demonstrate that pregnant women are expected to act as anticipating agents and that foetuses are treated as future children. Future images reveal how prenatal care reproduces gender norms.

The analysis revealed that while comprehensive SRH programs may have some opportunities and challenges to linking YEH to housing services that are consistent with traditional housing assistance programs, there are also factors specific to SRH programs. In particular, opportunities would be SRH programs employing a housing staff person and bolstering staff-youth meetings and communication. A challenge specific to SRH programs would be prioritizing youth's reproductive justice (i.e., choice) in lieu of solely prioritizing pregnancy reductions and delays; thus, it is recommended to train staff to prioritize youth's reproductive justice.

Moreover, extant studies often adjust for potential mediators, underestimating the average population effect. METHODS: We aimed to estimate the effect of unintended pregnancy on early childhood development in Ecuadorian children aged 3 to 5, participating in the National Health and Nutrition Survey 2018. We used a design-based doubly robust estimate. First, we used propensity score matching (1:1) to identify a subsample equally likely to come from a desired vs. unintended pregnancy based on geographic area, household income, paternal intendedness, the mother's current marital status, age, ethnicity, and educational level, depressive symptoms, and the child's gender and age. Then, we used a logistic regression model to explore the relation of maternal pregnancy intentions with adequate development, as defined by the Early Childhood Development Index (ECDI). While exempt from review by an Institutional Review Board, this secondary research was conducted in accord with prevailing ethical principles. RESULTS: Among 1694 observations representing 162,285 Ecuadorian children, unintended pregnancy associated with inadequate development (odds ratio: 1.56; 95% confidence interval: 1.06; 2.29), after adjusting for all relevant confounders. Unintended pregnancy was also negatively associated with all four ECDI domains, socio-emotional development being the most affected. DISCUSSION: Our doubly robust design found evidence of the relation between the maternal perception of pregnancy and early child development. Addressing this relation to achieve reproductive justice entails considering a wide spectrum of population health and legal interventions to allow adequate access to education, contraception, and safe abortion. Moreover, pre- and post-natal check-ups could screen for unintended pregnancy and provide support accordingly.",20230601,27,9,10.1007/s10995-023-03713-5,1573-6628,,

Given the barriers to care during the initial months of the pandemic, we sought to examine how postpartum contraception, sterilization, and visit attendance were affected during this period. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective chart review to examine contraception initiation, sterilization, and postpartum virtual and in-person visit attendance rates during the first six months (March 15 to September 7, 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the rates in the same period in the year prior at a single tertiary academic care center. We abstracted data from the first prenatal visit through twelve weeks postpartum. RESULTS: With the initiation of virtual appointments, postpartum visit attendance significantly increased (94.6 % vs 88.4 %, p < 0.001) during the pandemic with no difference in overall contraception uptake (51 % vs 54.1 %, p = 0.2) or sterilization (11.0 % vs 11.5 %, p = 0.88). During the pandemic, contraception prescribed differed significantly with a trend towards patient-administered methods including pills, patches, and rings (21 % vs 16 %, p = 0.02). In both periods, there was a significantly younger mean age (p < 0.001), higher proportion of non-White and non-Asian race (p < 0.001), public insurance (p = 0.003, 0.004), and an established contraceptive plan prenatally (p < 0.001) in the group that received contraception. CONCLUSION: As virtual postpartum visits were instituted, contraception initiation and sterilization were maintained at pre-pandemic rates and visit attendance rose despite the obstacles to care presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Provision of virtual postpartum visits may be a driver to maintain contraception and sterilization rates at a time, such as early in the COVID-19 pandemic, when patient care is at risk to be disrupted by social distancing, isolation, and avoidance of medical campuses.",20230409,36,,10.1016/j.srhc.2023.100844,1877-5764,,

We also address the importance of connecting nursing research, education and practice and offer suggestions on how to transform the teaching, research and clinical practice specific to Black maternal health. KNOWLEDGE DEVELOPMENT: A critical analysis of current Black maternal health teaching and research practices in nursing informed by the authors' experience in Black/African diasporic maternal health and reproductive justice. DISCUSSION: There is a need for nursing to be more intentional in addressing the effects of systemic racism on Black maternal health outcomes. In particular, there is still a substantial focus on race rather than racism as a risk factor. The focus on racial and cultural differences rather than systems of oppression continues to pathologize racialized groups while failing to address the impact of systemic racism on the health outcomes of Black women. CONCLUSION: Using a social determinant of health framework to examine maternal health disparities is useful; however, focusing on SDoH without challenging systems of oppression producing these disparities does not produce substantial changes. We suggest adding frameworks grounded in intersectionality, reproductive and racial justice and moving beyond biological assumptions about race that pathologize Black women. We also recommend a deliberate commitment to reshaping nursing research and education to centre anti-racist and anti-colonial practices that value community knowledge and practices.

Over 60,000 people were sterilised across the United States, victims of eugenic programs implemented in 32 states. Utah had a particularly aggressive eugenic sterilisation program, hailed by eugenicists for sterilising such a large proportion of its population, and lasting well into the 1970s. The goal of the present study was to determine who, at the demographic level, was targeted by this eugenic practice in Utah, and to also estimate how many survivors of the program might still be alive in 2023. Methods: We used archival records and data abstracted from charts at the Utah State Developmental Center to construct an observational cohort of people sterilised under Utah's coercive, eugenic sterilisation program. We described the demographics of the cohort and presented a life table analysis to estimate the number of survivors still living in 2023. Findings: At least 830 men, women, and children (modal age of 15-19, 53.6% female) were sterilised in Utah institutions under a program that was launched in 1925, peaked in the 1940s, and concluded in the 1970s. The life table analysis predicts approximately 54 survivors (36 women, 18 men), with an average age of 78. Interpretation: Many people sterilised under Utah's eugenics law are likely living today. While some states have taken steps to reckon with their roles in depriving people of their reproductive rights, Utah lacks even an official acknowledgment of this shameful, medical history. Given the advanced age of the potential survivors, time is running out for a reconciliation that can be experienced by those who were most harmed by the practice.

Reducing harm associated with this risk and its biopsychosocial consequences requires evidence-based, non-coercive interventions that ensure access to contraception for individuals who choose to prevent pregnancy. We examined feasibility and impact of SexHealth Mobile, a mobile unit-based intervention that aimed to increase access to patient-centered contraceptive care for individuals in SUD recovery programs. METHODS: We conducted a quasi-experimental study (enhanced usual care [EUC] followed by intervention) at three recovery centers with participants (n = 98) at risk for unintended pregnancy. EUC participants were offered printed information on community locations where they could access contraception care. SexHealth Mobile participants were offered same-day, onsite clinical consultation on a medical mobile unit and contraception if desired. The primary outcome was use of contraception (hormonal or intrauterine device) at one-month post-enrollment. Secondary outcomes were at two-weeks and three-months. Confidence in preventing unintended pregnancy, reasons for non-use of contraception at follow-up, and intervention feasibility were also assessed. RESULTS: Participants (median age = 31, range 19-40) enrolled in the intervention period were almost 10 times more likely to be using contraception at one-month (51.5%) versus the those enrolled in the EUC period (5.4%) (unadjusted relative risk [URR] = 9.3 [95%CI: 2.3-37.1]; adjusted relative risk [ARR] = 9.8 [95%CI: 2.4-39.2]). Intervention participants were also more likely to be using contraception at 2-weeks (38.7% vs. 2.6%; URR = 14.3 [95%CI: 2.0-104.1]) and three-months (40.9% vs. 13.9%; URR = 2.9 [95% CI: 1.1-7.4]). EUC participants reported more barriers (cost, time) and less confidence in preventing unintended pregnancies. Mixed-methods feasibility data indicated high acceptability and feasible integration into recovery settings. CONCLUSIONS: Mobile contraceptive care based on principles of reproductive justice and harm reduction reduces access barriers, is feasible to implement in SUD recovery settings, and increases contraception use.â¯Expanding interventions like SexHealth Mobile may help reduce harm from unintended pregnancies among individuals in SUD recovery.

First, we examine why most European legislations establish GA limits, and illustrate how abortion is framed in national laws and in the current national and international legal and political debates on abortion rights. We then show, based on research data we collected during our 5-year project and contextualized with existing data and statistics, how these restrictions force thousands of people to travel across borders from European countries where abortion is legal, delaying access to care, and increasing pregnant people's health risks. Finally, we explore, from an anthropological perspective, how pregnant people who travel across borders for abortion care conceptualize abortion access, and the relationship between the right to abortion care and the GA restrictions that limit this right. Our study participants criticize the time restrictions established by the laws in their countries of residence as failing to meet pregnant people's needs, highlight the crucial importance of easy, timely access to abortion care even beyond the first trimester of pregnancy, and suggest a more relational approach to the right to access safe, legal abortion. Abortion travel is also a matter of reproductive justice because access to care depends on specific resources including finances, information, support, citizenship status, and social networks.

STUDY DESIGN: From May 2021 to March 2022, a collaborative research team conducted a cross-sectional online survey using convenience sampling to recruit people who identify as Asian American, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander, Black or African American, Indigenous, or Latina/Latinx and used or wanted to use a contraceptive method in the past year. Respondents were recruited through reproductive justice and community-based organizations. RESULTS: Among 727 respondents, 45% reported experiencing at least one challenge accessing contraception in the past year of which 37% reported a logistical challenge, and 20% reported an interpersonal challenge. Sixty-seven percent of respondents said they were likely to use an OTC OCP.

This practice limits the generalizability of findings. Maximizing research strategies to meet the unique needs of these populations must be a priority. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to provide methodological context for the comprehensive application of reproductive justice strategies to guide research methods and promote engagement of underrepresented childbearing women while decreasing systemic bias. METHODS: In this article, we use a reproductive justice lens to characterize and define strategies for enhancing ethical and equitable engagement in research involving childbearing women who are often systematically underrepresented using a case study approach. Using a specific case study exemplar, the core tenets of reproductive justice are outlined and affirm the need to advance research strategies that create ethical engagement of diverse populations, transform oppressive social structures, and shift research paradigms so research objectives intentionally highlight the strengths and resiliency inherent to the targeted communities. RESULTS: We begin by describing parallels between the tenets of reproductive justice and the ethical principles of research (i.e., respect for persons, beneficence, and justice). We then apply these tenets to conceptualization, implementation (recruitment, data management, and retention), and dissemination of research conducted with childbearing women from diverse backgrounds who are systemically underrepresented. We highlight our successful research strategies from our case study example of women with histories of incarceration. DISCUSSION: To date, outcomes from our research indicate the need for multilevel strategies with a focus on respectful, inclusive participant and key community partner engagement; the time investment in local communities to promote equitable collaboration; encouragement of the patient's autonomous right to self-determination; and mitigation of power imbalances.

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted 25 semistructured qualitative interviews with physicians  and nurse practitioners from four specialties who provide contraceptive care to Latinas in Baltimore, MD. We analyzed data using directed content analysis. We discuss findings with attention to major constructs of PCC, applying a reproductive justice framework. RESULTS: Providers described a contraceptive counseling approach focused on pregnancy prevention as the primary goal. Most respondents used a tiered-effectiveness approach, even while noting the importance of PCC. Providers noted health system barriers to PCC, including time constraints and insurance status. Provider-reported patient-attributed barriers included low patient education/health literacy, culturally-attributed misconceptions about contraception, and language discordance. CONCLUSION: Providers described knowledge of and intention to practice PCC but had limited integration of it in their own counseling with Latinas. Responses suggest tension between an expressed desire to provide PCC and paternalistic counseling paradigms that prioritize pregnancy prevention over patient preferences. Inequitable health system barriers also interfere with true implementation of contraceptive PCC. IMPLICATIONS: Translating contraceptive PCC into practice, especially for marginalized communities, is paramount. Training should teach clinicians to recognize systems of structural inequity and discrimination that have informed approaches to counseling but are not reflective of PCC. Institutional policies must address health system barriers that also hamper PCC.",20221219,119,,10.1016/j.contraception.2022.109921,1879-0518,,

Secondarily, we aimed to assess the relationship between race and contraceptive delivery by telehealth. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using electronic health record data SETTING: Three adolescent medicine subspecialty clinics in a large academic hospital system, including an urban location and 2 suburban locations PARTICIPANTS: Patients assigned female sex at birth prescribed hormonal contraception between January 1st, 2018, and May 31st, 2021. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Method and type of contraceptive prescribed (short-acting, medium-acting, long-acting reversible contraception [LARC]) RESULTS: There were 2453 patients in the study; 47.5% were White, 36.0% were Black, and 8.1% identified as Hispanic. After controlling for insurance and age, Black patients, compared with non-Black patients, had twofold higher odds of receiving LARC compared with a short-acting method across the study period (aOR = 2.0; 95% CI, 1.52-2.62). We identified effect modification with significant interaction between Black race and the pandemic period, with evidence of a higher marginal probability of Black patients receiving LARCs during the pandemic. Additionally, during the pandemic, patients receiving new contraceptive prescriptions via telehealth were less likely to be Black (aOR = 0.63; 95% CI, 0.41-0.94) or publicly insured (aOR = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.38-0.81).

DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SETTING: Primary qualitative data from patients and providers at four clinics in an urban public mental health system serving individuals with chronic mental illness (collected November 2020-October 2021). STUDY DESIGN: This was an exploratory qualitative study with patients (English-speaking women of reproductive age, primarily Black or Latina) and mental health providers (psychiatrists, psychotherapists, case managers, nurses). We examined the acceptability of reproductive goals assessment within mental health care and obtained feedback on two reproductive goals assessment conversation guides: PATH (Pregnancy Attitudes, Timing, and How Important is Pregnancy Prevention) and OKQ (One Key Question). DATA COLLECTION: We conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with 22 patients and 36 providers. We used rapid qualitative analysis to summarize interview transcripts and identified themes using matrix analysis. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Perceptions of reproductive goals assessment were generally positive. Providers said the conversation guides would ""open the door"" to important discussions, support a better understanding of patients' goals, and facilitate medication counseling and planning. A minority of patients expressed discomfort or ambivalence; several suggested providers ask permission or allow patients to raise the topic. Additional themes included the need for framing to provide context for these personal questions, the need to build rapport before asking them, and the challenge of balancing competing priorities. Many participants found both PATH and OKQ prompts acceptable; some preferred the ""conversational"" and ""open-ended"" PATH phrasing. CONCLUSIONS: Participants perceived reproductive goals assessment as a promising practice in mental health care with unique functions in this setting. Areas of discomfort highlight the sensitivity of these topics for some women with chronic mental illness and suggest opportunities to tailor language, framing, and provider training to support effective and appropriate implementation.",20221208,58,2,10.1111/1475-6773.14111,1475-6773,,

National organizations recommend exclusively breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life and continued breastfeeding for the first 1-2 years of life. For physicians, childbearing years often coincide with key periods of training and their early career. Physician mothers have high rates of initiating breastfeeding but low success in maintaining breastfeeding. Breastfeeding discontinuation among physicians is a well-described, multifactorial issue that has persisted for decades. Reasons for discontinuation include inadequate access to pumping rooms, insufficient workplace and coworker support, and constrained schedules. Pumping is viewed as a burden to teammates and superiors, and physicians are often required to make up time spent pumping. Vague or absent policies to support breastfeeding by accreditation organizations and institutions create workplace conflict and impose additional stress on breastfeeding physicians, who devote significant time, energy, and mental reserves navigating clinical responsibilities, workplace relationships, and licensing requirements to pump. The authors propose several recommendations to improve the environment, support, and resources for breastfeeding physicians with a focus on what individuals, institutions, and professional organizations can do. Creating lactation policies that allow breastfeeding physicians equitable participation in the workplace is a matter of reproductive justice.

Findings highlight the efforts of many respondents to normalize abortion as an issue of women's health and women's rights. In fact, in response to the original post's discussion regarding valid reasons for an abortion, most respondents remarked similarly that any reason is valid. While study limitations include concerns regarding generalizability, this study provides access to abortion experiences outside of a traditional health clinic survey and insight into the abortion beliefs of women, both who have and have not experienced an abortion. Findings are in line with previous studies which found that multiple reasons are cited for obtaining an abortion, but also revealed a more supportive climate than the divisive discourse typically portrayed in the media. This suggests the timing may be conducive for efforts aiming to normalize abortion and reduce stigma, including potential avenues for interventions (e.g., social networks and platforms).

DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SETTING: Primary data were collected via a national online survey among people of color in the United States interested in pursuing midwifery education and careers between February 22 and May 2, 2021. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey consisted of 76 questions (75 closed-ended and 1 open-ended questions) including personal, familial, community, and societal motivators and barriers to pursuing midwifery. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: We recruited respondents 18 years and older who identified as persons of color by posting the survey link on midwifery, childbirth, and reproductive justice listservs, social media platforms, and through emails to relevant midwifery and doula networks. We conducted descriptive and bivariate analyses by demographic characteristics and used exemplar quotes from the open-ended question to illustrate findings from the descriptive data. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The strongest motivating factors for the 799 respondents were providing racially concordant care for community members (87.7 percent), reducing racial disparities in health (67.2 percent), and personal experiences related to midwifery care (55.4 percent) and health care more broadly (54.6 percent). Main barriers to entering midwifery were direct (58.2 percent) and related (27.5 to 52.8 percent) costs of midwifery education, and lack of racial concordance in midwifery education and the midwifery profession (31.5 percent) that may contribute to racially motivated exclusion of people of color. Financial and educational barriers were strongest among those with lower levels of income or education. CONCLUSIONS: Structural and interpersonal racisms are both motivators and barriers for aspiring midwives of color. Expanding and diversifying the perinatal workforce by addressing the financial and educational barriers of aspiring midwives of color, such as providing funding and culturally-competent midwifery education, creating a robust pipeline, and opening more midwifery schools, is a matter of urgency to address the maternal health crisis.",20220716,58,1,10.1111/1475-6773.14037,1475-6773,,

Black woman-led organizations and stakeholders recommend a thoughtful integration of Reproductive Justice for any LARC programs. This paper will describe how one state-funded maternal and child health program reconceptualized an evidence-based strategy (EBS) focused on increasing access to LARC, to a broader strategy that incorporated principles of Reproductive Justice to improve birth outcomes. DESCRIPTION: In 2016, North Carolina established the Improving Community Outcomes for Maternal and Child Health (ICO4MCH) program. As part of this program, five county health departments were awarded funding to ""increase access to LARC"". Noting community partners' concerns with this strategy, ICO4MCH leadership revised the strategy to focus on using the Reproductive Justice framework to improve utilization of reproductive life planning and access to LARC. Leaders modified the strategy by changing performance measures and scope of work/deliverables required by grantees. ASSESSMENT: Using quarterly reports and focus group data from ICO4MCH grantees, we identified key steps communities have taken to prioritize Reproductive Justice. Key findings include that sites hosted Reproductive Justice trainings for team members and changed language describing family planning services. These activities were tailored to fit community context and existing perceptions about reproductive health services. CONCLUSION: The ICO4MCH program was able to modify a LARC EBS to better emphasize Reproductive Justice. Local agencies desiring to shift their LARC programs should include and value feedback from those with lived experience and partner with organizations committed to Reproductive Justice.",20221109,27,1,10.1007/s10995-022-03563-7,1573-6628,,

Our goal in this study was to ask Black mothers who had recently given birth about the quality of their birthing experiences as well as their level of respect from, trust in, and satisfaction with their maternity healthcare providers. DESIGN: This study gathered data from Black mothers (N = 209) who had given birth within the past two years, using a cross-sectional online survey measuring several variables about the birthing experience including types of healthcare provider communication, provider respect for the mother, trust, birth satisfaction, and emotional responses to birth. RESULTS: Provider-centered communication, although preferred by some mothers, was associated with lower birth satisfaction and stronger negative emotions whereas positive birth satisfaction was linked to patient-centered communication which resulted in positive emotions. While most mothers reported overall satisfaction with their birth experience, nearly half reported experiencing some degree of disrespect from their healthcare providers during labor and birth. Moreover, trust and respect mediated the relationship for patient-centered communication with positive emotion and birth satisfaction. Over one-third of participants gave birth with a certified nurse midwife attending. There were no differences in perception of being respected or the quality of birth given the professional identity of the provider as an Obstetrician/Gynecologist or as a midwife. The advice suggested by Black mothers for their healthcare providers was instructive in identifying ways those providers could better serve their patients during birth. CONCLUSION: This study showed that there is still additional work that needs to be done for racial equity and respect during birth.

Memphis, Tennessee, has a history of limited community birth options (birthing outside of hospital walls). In 2017, when home birth services were added to CHOICES and plans for opening Memphis' first freestanding birth center were being imagined, it was intentional to create a model in which midwifery care could be accessible for patients who may be eligible for state-funded health care services, those considered at higher health risk than traditional low-risk midwifery patients, or both. In fact, individuals and their families with limited out-of-pocket funds and those historically marginalized would purposely receive holistic, individualized care based on their unique health care needs and personal desires, driven by a reproductive justice framework. In this article, we outline the success and challenges of addressing the reproductive health needs of marginalized communities, including the benefits of a nonprofit business model, operationalizing reproductive justice concepts, and the reclamation of Black midwifery. We also discuss the challenges of caring for Black birthing people and providing abortion and gender-affirming care in a politically hostile environment. Although individuals have complex needs, at its core, CHOICES believes that every person must be seen as whole human beings and that each can be cared for by a midwife. The CHOICES approach is informed by evidence-based information, clinical judgment, and an intentional partnership with and investment in a people who have historically been and are presently pushed to the margins, neglected, and blamed for poor health outcomes and demise. Striving to adapt the CHOICES model of care in other parts of the country is important now more than ever following the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v.

Studies outside of Canada indicate rates of abortion are higher among people experiencing incarceration than in the general population, and that abortion access is often problematic. Although international standards for abortion care among incarcerated populations exist, there conversely appear to be no Canadian guidelines or procedures to facilitate unintended pregnancy prevention or management. Barriers to abortion care inequitably restrict people with unintended pregnancy from attaining education and employment opportunities, cause entrenchment in violent relationships, and prevent people from choosing to parent when they are ready and able. Understanding and facilitating equitable access to abortion care for incarcerated people is critical to address structural, gender-, and race-based reproductive health inequities, and to promote reproductive justice.

The construct of disrespect and abuse has been widely applied to similar phenomena in maternity care and could help to better understand provider mistreatment of family planning clients. With a focus on public-sector family planning provision in western Kenya, we aim to estimate the prevalence and impact of disrespect and abuse from a variety of perspectives and advance methodological approaches to measuring this construct in the context of family planning provision. We combine and triangulate data from a variety of sources across five counties in western Kenya, including 180 mystery clients, 253 third-party observations, eight focus group discussions, 19 key informant interviews, and two journey mapping workshops. Across both mystery client and third-party observations conducted in public-sector facilities in western Kenya, approximately one out of every ten family planning seekers was treated with disrespect by their provider. Family planning clients were frequently scolded for seeking family planning while unmarried or low parity, but mistreatment was not limited to women with these specific characteristics. Women were also insulted for such characteristics as body size or perceived sexual promiscuity. Qualitative data confirmed both that client disrespect is widespread and leads women to avoid family planning services even when they desire to use a contraceptive method, sometimes leading to unintended pregnancies. Key informants attribute disrespectful provider practices to both low technical skill as well as poor motivation stemming from both intrinsic values as well as extrinsic factors such as low wages and high caseloads. Possible solutions suggested by key informants included changes to recruitment and admission for Kenyan medical/nursing schools, as well as values clarification to shift provider motivations. Interventions to reduce mistreatment must be multi-layered and well-evidenced to ensure that family planning clients receive the person-centered care that enables them to achieve their contraceptive desires and reproductive freedom.",20221223,2,,10.1016/j.ssmqr.2022.100178,2667-3215,,

Though the public may expect physicians to hold purely scientific attitudes about abortion, their attitudes and behaviors are just as strongly informed by social and political factors as the public's. In a recent survey study of physicians at an academic medical center about their abortion attitudes, most reported strong support for abortion access. However, more were unwilling to consult in abortion-related cases, and many perceived little or no professional connection to abortion and were reticent to publicly advocate for their position. METHODS: In order to investigate the nuances in physicians' abortion attitudes, we analyzed the open-ended, qualitative responses provided by physicians at the end of a quantitative survey using modified concept mapping procedures and theme generation. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-two open-ended responses resulted in 487 data units. We categorized respondents' comments into 2 main groups: attempts to depersonalize, or distance oneself, from abortion and expressions of nuance or ambivalence about abortion. Ambivalence and nuance in abortion attitudes centered around multiple factors that varied from individual to structural. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support previous literature suggesting that physicians' abortion attitudes are not binary and add that nuanced attitudes may be perceived as unwelcome. Acknowledging ambivalence and addressing physicians' tendency to depersonalize abortion could result in more honest, open, and nuanced discourse and contribute to addressing structural issues that result in poor health outcomes, achieving broader reproductive justice goals, and greater access to abortion services.",20221027,121,3,,2379-3961,,

Design: We conducted topic-specific (eg, reproductive justice) and population-specific (eg, Asian and Pacific Islander) focus groups (N=16 focus groups) in rapid succession using Zoom software. Methods: A self-reflexive, iterative praxis guided theorization, data collection and analysis. We obtained community input on study design, the semi-structured discussion guide, ethical considerations and dissemination. Applying PHCRP, we assessed our assumptions iteratively. We transcribed each interview verbatim, de-identified the data, then used two distinct qualitative techniques to code and analyze them: thematic analysis to identify unifying concepts that recur across focus groups and narrative analysis to keep each participant's story intact. Results: The praxis facilitated relationship-building with partners and supported the iterative assessment of assumptions. Logistical constraints included difficulty ensuring the confidentiality of virtual discussions. Conclusions: These novel approaches provide an effective model for community-engaged qualitative research during a pandemic.",20220801,32,3,10.18865/ed.32.3.243,1945-0826,,

The reproductive justice framework provided a theoretical lens for examining the women's rights to bodily autonomy, to have or not have children, and to live in safe, sustainable environments given the intersection of incarceration and sexual violence. RESULTS: Women (N = 12) recounted their experiences of sexual violence after having been incarcerated. Incarceration and resulting sexual violence led to discrimination, limited bodily autonomy, sexual exploitation, substance use, depression, anxiety, re-traumatization, recidivism, underreporting of violence, underutilization of healthcare resources, strained relationships, family separation, and unsafe environments. CONCLUSIONS: More research is needed to understand the social, economic, and political contexts that perpetuate sexual violence among justice-involved women.

In this paper we present a qualitative meta-synthesis of 31 papers reporting qualitative studies of how people who are incarcerated in prisons and jails around the world experience pregnancy, labour and childbirth, and the postpartum period. Theoretical perspectives from the reproductive justice and prison abolition movements guided our analysis, which identified connectedness (to baby) and disconnectedness (from support) as twinned themes characterizing the lived experiences of navigating pregnancy in a carceral institution. We argue that the conditions of reproductive justice - including self-determination in pregnancy, in parenting, and in managing one's reproductive capacity - are fundamentally irreconcilable with mass incarceration.

Specifically, the current literature lacks research pertaining to the experiences of postpartum AI/AN women, their culture, birthing and mothering expectations, and trauma. This qualitative study used the theories of becoming a mother, historical-trauma framework, and reproductive justice as they relate to Indigenous women's personal and historical trauma to assess their lived experiences of becoming a mother. METHODS: Keetoowah mothers (N = 8) were interviewed by using a story inquiry method to understand the perinatal experiences of members of one Indigenous tribe in the US. FINDINGS: The story inquiry coding resulted in two main themes, namely maternal mental health challenges and inadequacies of perinatal care. CONCLUSION: The subthemes illuminate the intersection of historical trauma and the perinatal experience, continued colonization of mothering, and the resilience of tribal culture during the postpartum period.

A mother or birthing person's mental health before and during pregnancy and the postpartum period is essential for a child's development. During the first year of life, infants require emotional attachment and bonding to strive. Perinatal mood disorders are likely to hinder attachment and are associated with an increased risk of adverse mental health effects for children later in life. The Black community is faced with a crisis as Black mothers experience a higher prevalence of perinatal mood disorders, including postpartum depression and anxiety, compared to the United States national estimates. The aim of the research is to identify social, structural, and economic disparities of Black perinatal women and birthing people's experience to understand the impact of perinatal mental health on infants' mental health. Black mothers and birthing people may often face social and structural barriers that limit their opportunity to seek and engage with interventions and treatment that address the root causes of their perinatal mood disorder. To enhance understanding of racial disparities caused by social and structural determinants of health on Black mothers and birthing people's mental health and health care experiences that influence infant mental health, the study team conducted semi-structured interviews among self-identified cisgender Black women health professionals nationwide, who provide care to pregnant or postpartum Black women and birthing people. Our study attempted to identify themes, pathways, interventions, and strategies to promote equitable and anti-racist maternal and infant mental health care. Using a Rigorous and Accelerated Data Reduction (Radar) technique and a deductive qualitative analytic approach it was found that limited access to resources, lack of universal screening and mental health education, and the disjointed healthcare system serves as barriers, contribute to mental health issues, and put Black mothers and birthing people at a disadvantage in autonomous decision making. Our study concluded that instituting education on healthy and culturally appropriate ways to support infant development in parent education programs may support Black parents in establishing healthy attachment and bonds. Prioritizing strategies to improve maternal mental health and centering Black parents in developing these educational parenting programs may optimize parenting experiences.",20220516,13,,10.3389/fpsyt.2022.807235,1664-0640,,

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted semistructured key-informant interviews (n = 22) with stakeholders representing diverse sectors, including primary care (family medicine) and specialty (obstetrician/gynecologist) physicians, health educators/promoters, advocates, and public health/health care professionals. Grounded theory methodology informed sampling and thematic analysis within and across sectors. RESULTS: Key informants across sectors supported integrating reproductive health services into primary care. Pregnancy intention screening was considered appropriate yet required improved measures. Such screening was viewed as fostering childbearing discussions and counseling for contraception/preconception health that could benefit patients while also requiring attention to concerns from the patient (e.g., potential for coercion, access barriers) and health care systems (e.g., buy-in, training) contexts. Three themes related to LARC included provider bias, knowledge and training, counseling and patient education, and logistics/financial situation, which were differentially emphasized by stakeholder sector; providers expressed greater concern regarding training, bias, and logistical considerations, whereas health educators and advocates focused on patient education and autonomous decision-making. Similarly, awareness of reproductive justice principles varied by sector. CONCLUSION: There is consensus among informants from the 5 sectors for expanding reproductive health services in primary care. This will require reproductive health-related training for providers, organizational buy-in, and system protocol changes, including unbiased contraceptive counseling of all methods, specifically balancing discussion of LARC effectiveness with information regarding side effects. Incorporating reproductive justice principles may increase informed patient decision-making and reproductive autonomy. IMPLICATIONS: Expanding reproductive health services in primary care requires provider training and protocols for patient-centered care, including unbiased provision of all contraceptive options. The reproductive justice framework offers the possibility of addressing diverse stakeholders' concerns for both preconception and contraceptive care with patient decision-making at the forefront.",20220524,112,,10.1016/j.contraception.2022.05.008,1879-0518,,

Economic adversity and implicit bias during clinical encounters may lead to physiological responses that place Black women at higher risk for adverse birth outcomes. The novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) further exacerbated this risk, as safety protocols increased social isolation in clinical settings, thereby limiting opportunities to advocate for unbiased care. Twitter, 1 of the most popular social networking sites, has been used to study a variety of issues of public interest, including health care. This study considers whether posts on Twitter accurately reflect public discourse during the COVID-19 pandemic and are being used in infodemiology studies by public health experts. Objective: This study aims to assess the feasibility of Twitter for identifying public discourse related to social determinants of health and advocacy that influence maternal health among Black women across the United States and to examine trends in sentiment between 2019 and 2020 in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Tweets were collected from March 1 to July 13, 2020, from 21 organizations and influencers and from 4 hashtags that focused on Black maternal health. Additionally, tweets from the same organizations and hashtags were collected from the year prior, from March 1 to July 13, 2019. Twint, a Python programming library, was used for data collection and analysis. We gathered the text of approximately 17,000 tweets, as well as all publicly available metadata. Topic modeling and k-means clustering were used to analyze the tweets. Results: A variety of trends were observed when comparing the 2020 data set to the 2019 data set from the same period. The percentages listed for each topic are probabilities of that topic occurring in our corpus. In our topic models, tweets on reproductive justice, maternal mortality crises, and patient care increased by 67.46% in 2020 versus 2019. Topics on community, advocacy, and health equity increased by over 30% in 2020 versus 2019. In contrast, tweet topics that decreased in 2020 versus 2019 were as follows: tweets on Medicaid and medical coverage decreased by 27.73%, and discussions about creating space for Black women decreased by just under 30%. Conclusions: The results indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic may have spurred an increased focus on advocating for improved reproductive health and maternal health outcomes among Black women in the United States. Further analyses are needed to capture a longer time frame that encompasses more of the pandemic, as well as more diverse voices to confirm the robustness of the findings. We also concluded that Twitter is an effective source for providing a snapshot of relevant topics to guide Black maternal health advocacy efforts.",20220517,2,1,10.2196/30885,2564-1891,,

Race is a social construct and not an inherent biologic or genetic reality; therefore, racial differences in health outcomes represent the consequences of structural racism or the inequitable distribution of opportunities for health along racialized lines. Clinicians and scientists in obstetrics and gynecology have a responsibility to work to eliminate health inequities for Black, Brown, and Indigenous birthing people, and fulfilling this responsibility requires actionable evidence from high-quality research. To generate this actionable evidence, the research community must realign paradigms, praxis, and infrastructure with an eye directed toward reproductive justice and antiracism. This special report offers a set of key recommendations as a roadmap to transform perinatal health research to achieve health equity. The recommendations are based on expert opinion and evidence presented at the State of the Science Research Symposium at the 41st Annual Pregnancy Meeting of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine in 2021. Recommendations fall into 3 broad categories-changing research paradigms, reforming research praxis, and transforming research infrastructure-and are grounded in a historic foundation of the advances and shortcomings of clinical, public health, and sociologic scholarship in health equity. Changing the research paradigm requires leveraging a multidisciplinary perspective on structural racism; promoting mechanistic research that identifies the biologic pathways perturbed by structural racism; and utilizing conceptual models that account for racism as a factor in adverse perinatal outcomes. Changing praxis approaches to promote and engage multidisciplinary teams and to develop standardized guidelines for data collection will ensure that paradigm shifts center the historically marginalized voices of Black, Brown, and Indigenous birthing people. Finally, infrastructure changes that embed community-centered approaches are required to make shifts in paradigm and praxis possible. Institutional policies that break down silos and support true community partnership, and also the alignment of institutional, funding, and academic publishing objectives with strategic priorities for perinatal health equity, are paramount. Achieving health equity requires shifting the structures that support the ecosystem of racism that Black, Brown, and Indigenous birthing people must navigate before, during, and after childbearing. These structures extend beyond the healthcare system in which clinicians operate day-to-day, but they cannot be excluded from research endeavors to create the actionable evidence needed to achieve perinatal health equity.",20220521,227,4,10.1016/j.ajog.2022.05.033,1097-6868,,

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted an internet-based survey between June 2017 and August 2017 among Asian and Latinx undocumented immigrants (N = 204) aged 18-31 years in California. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were conducted to examine the associations between DACA status and contraceptive use and consistency. RESULTS: Among undocumented participants who were sexually active, about 60% reported having unprotected sex (52% DACA vs. 63% non-DACA) and about 80% reported that documentation status affects how they access care for sexual/reproductive health at least a little. Overall, Asians were 81% less likely to have unprotected sex compared to Latinx individuals (aOR = 0.19, 95%CI: 0.06, 0.56). DACA recipients were more likely to report using contraception every time compared to non-recipients (42.9% vs. 30.5%, p = 0.04).

The battle to make abortion illegal has been predicated on three nebulous assumptions about how abortion bans work. First, supporters believe banning abortion will deter it. Second, they hope bans will send a message about abortion-specifically, that abortion is immoral. And third, they expect bans to be competently implemented and enforced. Drawing on empirical work from within and outside of the U.S., this Article offers an evidence-based assessment of each of these assumptions. Part One examines the question of deterrence by exploring findings from countries with relatively high and relatively low abortion rates. After explaining why restrictive abortion laws alone do not reduce aggregate abortion rates, I consider the matter of individual deterrence. By identifying those most likely to be deterred by U.S. abortion bans, I illustrate how abortion bans intersect with structural inequalities to disproportionately impact poor women of color and their children. Part Two tests the idea that abortion bans send a message. I consider the bans' meaning in context with U.S. laws and policies affecting families, exposing the difference between laws discouraging abortion, and those encouraging childbirth. Then, drawing from literature on the expressive function of the law, I assess the limits on the message-sending capacity of abortion bans in a society divided over abortion and over its commitment to children living in poverty. Part Three turns to the expectation that abortion bans will be competently enforced, noting the legitimacy struggles arising from law enforcement patterns, along with the administrative challenges inherent in overseeing the various exceptions to abortion bans. This article concludes by considering why the consequences and limitations of abortion bans should matter to supporters and opponents, alike.",20220502,9,1,10.1093/jlb/lsac011,2053-9711,,

(4) Do healthcare workers recognize and engage with structural inequities? RESULTS: Seventy-eight key informants (i.e., clinicians, operations staff, administrators) participated. In nine study sites, we observed evidence of interviewees both mitigating and perpetuating reproductive injustice. Many aspired to provide compassionate, patient-centered care, avoid paternalism, and foster patient autonomy. Simultaneously, interviewees demonstrated biases, including implicit subscription to an ideology of stratified reproduction, stereotyping, and ""othering."" Even when interviewees endorsed goals of patient-centeredness, care delivery processes sometimes prioritized healthcare systems' needs, and patients were not included on quality improvement teams. Many interviewees recognized structural inequities as driving health outcome disparities, yet relied on individual-level solutions like long-acting reversible contraception, and not structural-level interventions, to address them. CONCLUSION: Alongside enthusiasm for delivering compassionate care exist biases, missed opportunities to center patients, and lack of curiosity about the appropriateness of solving structural-level problems with individual-level solutions. IMPLICATIONS: Our findings call for individual and institutional self-reflection, partnership with patients and communities, and other intentional efforts to mitigate potential for harm in initiatives enhancing access to contraceptive care.",20220419,113,,10.1016/j.contraception.2022.04.004,1879-0518,,

Participants: Analysis was on secondary data from the Integrated Postsecondary Data System and the U.S. Census Bureau. Methods: We utilized a framework of Reproductive Justice to assess and interpret the accessibility of abortion providers to college students by mapping reproductive health centers and nonprofit institutions of higher education, then using these data to statistically compare racial demographics, female employment, and insurance coverage between institutions with and without access. Results: Of nonprofit postsecondary institutions in Colorado, 11 institutions lack access, serving â¼38,900 students. Of these students, 88.7% attend a Minority Serving Institution (MSI). MSIs lacking abortion access had 8% more female enrollment [t(18.32) = -2.04, p = 0.027]. Campuses possessing student health centers are less likely to have an MSI designation (50% with vs. 82% without), have greater female Hispanic enrollment by 10% [t(23.72) = 3.11, p = 0.005] and lower female multiracial enrollment by 2% [t(37.00) = 2.20, p = 0.034].

ANOVA results indicated separate patterns of differences for Zip Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) demographics for Asian, black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, Other Race, and Nonresident populations. Planned contrasts demonstrated that this difference was greatest at the 30-minute drive-time access, supporting the use of 30-minute drive time as an important indicator of access. Conclusions: The colleges lacking access to a provider are predominantly MSIs in lower income communities.

Recently, there has been an uptick in research funding to identify and address root causes, particularly among at-risk groups. However, given the historical trauma experienced by Black populations in research settings, novel approaches built firmly on ethical principles and grounded in a framework of reproductive justice are necessary to minimize harm and center the research process on maintaining the dignity and respect of research participants. METHODS: Ethical principles as outlined by the American Nurses Association, Black Mamas Matter Alliance, and federal research guidelines are reviewed within the context of conducting maternal mortality-focused research. In addition, community developed research frameworks and methodologies are presented and discussed within the research context. CONCLUSIONS: Black pregnant people have reported mistreatment during clinical encounters; therefore, intentional protections to promote safety must be considered in the research setting.

Communities of color have a higher prevalence of abortion use but face many barriers, including financial and geographic barriers, to abortion access. Preliminary evidence on telehealth for medication abortion shows that it is highly acceptable, accommodating of patient needs, and may allow patients to access abortion care at earlier gestational ages. However, evidence during the COVID-19 pandemic shows that utilization of telehealth is lower among communities of color. We describe how systemic barriers, including regulations on or laws banning telehealth for medication abortion, disinvestments in digital access, and restrictions on public insurance coverage, could perpetuate lower utilization of telehealth for medication abortion care among communities of color.

Background: Overdose related maternal mortality, often involving opioids, is a national growing public health concern. OUD is a highly stigmatized condition that may negatively influence the well-being of pregnant/parenting individual's reproductive and human rights. Study Design: Secondary qualitative data analysis. Methods: A secondary data analysis was conducted using individual interviews (N = 23) from a larger study aimed at examining contextual factors surrounding pregnant/parenting individual's experiences with opioid use return to use and/or overdose. The RJ framework was used as a framework to examine the influence of OUD-related stigma and a person's right to bodily autonomy, their right to parent, and their right to parent the children they have in safe and sustainable environments. Results: The RJ framework supported the examination of factors that perpetuate stigma in this population. Individuals described stigmatizing experiences in the health care setting. Verbal and nonverbal interactions with health care providers and fear of child welfare involvement were counterproductive to recovery and potentially triggered OUD recurrence and/or overdose. Conclusions: Due to existing stigma, pregnant and parenting individuals with OUD often avoided health care and recovery support services; therefore, there should be the removal of barriers that prevent this population from accessing life-saving services.

We argue that, whilst there are many factors driving the unregulated route to DI, restrictive UK policies and practices for regulated DI might be one of these.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness and safety of intrauterine contraceptives (IUC) to laparoscopic tubal ligation for Medicaid clients. DESIGN: We partnered with patient and clinician stakeholders to conduct a retrospective cohort study using California Medicaid claims for patients who had an IUC placed or laparoscopic tubal ligation performed in 2008-2014, excluding procedures performed within 42 days of a birth. We applied log-linear (Poisson) event-history regression models for clustered person-period data to adjust for sociodemographic variables and pre-procedure health status when examining associations between these contraceptive procedures and claims related to contraceptive failure, complications, and pain in the first year post-procedure. KEY RESULTS: We identified 35,705 patients who had a levonorgestrel IUC placed, 23,628 patients who had a copper IUC placed, and 23,965 patients who underwent laparoscopic tubal ligation. In unadjusted analyses, rates of pregnancy within 1 year were similar following levonorgestrel IUC (2.40%) or copper IUC placement (2.99%) or tubal ligation (2.64%). In adjusted analyses, compared to tubal ligation, pregnancy was less common following placement of a levonorgestrel IUC (adj IRR 0.72, 95% CI 0.64-0.82) and similar with placement of a copper IUC (adj IRR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82-1.05). Procedural complications such as infection (0.35% vs. 2.91%) were significantly less common with IUC placement than tubal ligation. Claims for pelvic and abdominal pain decreased in frequency with time since all procedures; 6 to 12 months post-procedure, pelvic pain claims were less common after levonorgestrel IUC (adj IRR 0.69, 95% CI 0.65-0.73) or copper IUC placement (adj IRR 0.70, 95% CI 0.66-0.75) than tubal ligation. CONCLUSIONS: IUC appears at least as effective as laparoscopic tubal ligation at 1-year post-procedure with lower rates of infection and pelvic pain 6 to 12 months post-procedure.

The participants were reflective of our patient population in the Bronx, with ninety percent using Medicaid for insurance and fifteen percent concerned about food security in the past month, well-validated questions reflective of poverty and socioeconomic status. Three themes emerged from the interviews: (1) using contraception was described as a selfish decision by the mother without benefit to the newborn; (2) women felt pressure to breastfeed and saw the inability to breastfeed as a personal failure; and (3) medical providers were viewed as more trustworthy when it came to information regarding breastfeeding as opposed to contraceptive options, where decisions relied on anecdotes from friends or family.

Whilst some claim that reform was overdue, critics have described the new legislation as the 'world's most extreme abortion law'. This article investigates these claims through the lens of reproductive justice, a movement that emerged alongside the global campaign for recognition of reproductive rights. First, it outlines the tenets of reproductive justice, before critiquing New Zealand's previous law, and considering arguments for its modernisation. It then describes how a growing number of jurisdictions have decriminalised abortion, with increasing pressure on other countries, including England and Wales, to similarly undertake law reform. Finally, it examines the main provisions of New Zealand's law. It concludes that, to the extent that the new law enables access to timely, equitable, and publicly funded abortion services, it is consistent with the tenets of reproductive justice. By placing women at the centre of the law, it improves the welfare of women, but particularly marginalised women.

Globally portrayed as aspirational and mostly uninterrogated, it is crucial to have a thorough bioethical evaluation of a Nordic model informed by Black and queer perspectives. We have come to conceptualize the Finnish welfare state as haunted. We fear that the seemingly non-racial racial hygiene continues to haunt bioethics of the welfare state as structural racism. A key cause for this concern is the lack of racial awareness in public politics and the reluctance in discussing racism due to the national agenda of color-blindness. This crucially compounds to our findings that medical professionals prefer to think they operate on ""purely medical"" reasoning as opposed to nuanced ethical contemplation, the latter associated with ""social issues"" that allegedly cannot be resolved and are outside medical interest. We discuss how the bioethical aftermath of eugenics remains unresolved. Racist, classist, sexist, ableist, and cis- and heteronormative stratification of reproduction requires a nuanced moral compass for Nordic welfare state bioethics, not ""strictly medical practice.""

METHODS: Thirteen collaborators (four women, four support group leaders, and five health professionals) were recruited from church support groups, a family medicine residency clinic, and the health department. Data were collected through field observations, six one-on-one interviews, one small group interview, and one focus group. RESULTS: Thematic analysis identified six key themes related to socioeconomic factors and racism in women's and infant health: Public Apathy; Violence and Stress; Discrimination; Mistrust; Spiritual and Social Support; Reproductive Justice. CONCLUSIONS FOR PRACTICE: These themes point out failures in health care, social services, and policy initiatives that do not meet women's and infant needs, in addition to some opportunities to implement successful practices.

They also experience high rates of morbidity and mortality; however, there is limited data related to their health inequities. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate systemic inequities associated with discrimination using the Reproductive Justice Framework to observe factors that influenced depressive symptomology in Hispanic women. METHODS: A path analysis was conducted to evaluate systemic inequities that influenced postpartum depression using the public database, Listening to Mothers III (LMIII). The sub-sample consisted of n = 406 Hispanic mothers. Data was initially collected between the years 2011 and 2013. RESULTS: Hispanic mothers were more likely to experience occurrences of perceived discrimination while seeking perinatal healthcare. These occurrences of discrimination led to lower trust in their healthcare providers, lower satisfaction with care, more instances of unwanted medical procedures, the need to feel to hold back comments about their health which ultimately resulted in higher rates of self-reported postpartum depression. The model fit indices supported the model's plausibility (&#967;2 /df ratio = 3.16, Comparative Fit Index = 0.91, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation = 0.06).

STUDY DESIGN: This qualitative study involved individual interviews with 15 clinicians working in obstetrics and gynecology in South Carolina about their approaches to contraceptive counseling. We analyzed the data using a combination of deductive and inductive approaches. RESULTS: Clinicians attributed challenges of working with diverse patient populations to patients' race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and age. Clinicians often interpreted patient concerns about or refusal to use effective contraceptive methods as a problem with patients themselves. When clinicians described patients in disparaging ways, they often focused on adolescent patients. CONCLUSION: Bias informed by structural inequalities and power relations influences how clinicians perceive their patients and approach counseling them about contraception. Such practices may limit patients' informed decision-making and autonomy regarding initiating or continuing contraceptive use.

The concept of reproductive justice has been employed in the social sciences for almost 30 years, yet nursing has been slow to adopt this concept in promoting maternal-child health. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the concept of reproductive justice as used in peer-reviewed publications with the aim of reframing black maternal health in public health nursing scholarship, research, practice, and advocacy. DESIGN: We conducted a systematic review of the social science literature. We analyzed selected articles though a principle-based concept analysis focusing on epistemological, pragmatic, linguistic, and logical principles. SAMPLE: Eight articles were selected from a pool of 377. RESULTS: Race was identified as a source of power for understanding reproductive justice through individual knowledge, collective knowledge, and praxis. Pragmatically, reproductive justice is a social justice-oriented platform that bridges the pro-choice/pro-life divide; aids coalition building; and promotes inclusion. Linguistically, the concept is distinct from both reproductive health and reproductive rights. Reproductive justice is logically situated within intersectionality theory and the cumulative embodiment of oppressions Black women experience based on race, class, and gender. CONCLUSION: Reproductive justice reframes public health nursing actions for Black women by focusing on uncovering systems of oppression, recognizing past historical injustices, and advancing cultural safety in health promotion. Multilevel interventions are needed to simultaneously address these injustices particularly in the areas of preconception health, maternal health, infant and child health, and Black family well-being across the reproductive lifespan.",20210510,39,1,10.1111/phn.12919,1525-1446,,

Black birthing communities are most impacted by these inequities due to structural racism throughout society and within health care settings. Although multiple studies have shown that structural racism and the disrespect associated with this system of inequity are the root causes of observed perinatal inequities, little scholarship has centered the needs of Black birthing communities to create alternative care models. Leaning on reproductive justice and critical race theoretical frameworks, this study explores good birth experiences as described by Black birthing people. Methods: Thematic analysis of two focus groups and three one-on-one interviews conducted with clients at a Black-owned free-standing culturally-centered birth center (n=10). Results: We found that Black birthing persons' concerns centered on three main themes: agency, historically- and culturally-safe birthing experiences, and relationship-centered care. Many participants pointed directly to past experiences of medical mistreatment and obstetric racism when defining their ideal birth experience. Conclusion: Black birthing people seeking care from culturally-informed providers often do so because they have been mistreated, disregarded, and neglected within traditional care settings. The needs articulated by our study participants provide a powerful framework for understanding alternative patient-centered models of care that can be developed to improve the care experiences of Black birthing people in the pursuit of birth equity.",20230605,15,2,,2166-5222,,

The medicalization of pregnancy and childbirth, and its detrimental impacts on Black birth, is well documented. The Black Lives Matter movement has elevated the national consciousness on all aspects of Black life, but significant attention has been directed toward the murder and dehumanization of Black men and boys. Black midwives, caring for Black people, using the Midwives Model of Care© which consistently demonstrates its efficacy and better outcomes for Black people, are uniquely positioned to witness the physical and psychosocial experiences of birthing Black boys in America. METHODS: Between 2011 and 2013, the first author conducted interviews with 22 Black midwives to understand their perceptions of, and experiences in, predominantly white midwifery education programs and professional organizations. Convenience and snowball sampling were used. This paper investigates previously unreported and unexamined data from the original study by focusing on the witness and insight of nine midwives who provided care for Black mothers of boys during pregnancy and childbirth. FINDINGS: The data presented three themes: It's a Boy: On Restlessness and Complicated Uneasiness; Desensitization of Black Death; and, Physiological Impacts of Toxic Stress. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate that caring for Black people must be simultaneously theorized and executed within an anti-racist, relationship-centered, reproductive justice framework.

METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study with 60 semistructured interviews at 3 teaching hospitals in Texas with physicians, nurses, administrators and other staff who participated in the implementation of immediate postpartum LARC. Physicians self-identified as champions and identified other champion physicians and administrators. Two researchers analyzed and coded interview transcripts for content and themes. RESULTS: We found that champions draw on institutional knowledge and relationships to build awareness and support for immediate postpartum LARC implementation. To obtain buy-in, champions needed to demonstrate financial sustainability, engage key stakeholders from multiple departments, and obtain nurse buy-in. Champions also created buy-in by communicating goals for the service that focused on expanding reproductive autonomy, improving maternal health, and improving access to postpartum contraception. Some staff, especially nurses, identified reasons for the program that run counter to reproductive justice principles: reducing birth rates, poverty, and/or unplanned pregnancy among young women and high-parity women. Respondents at 2 hospitals noted that not all women had equitable access to immediate postpartum LARC. CONCLUSION: Physician and non-physician champions must secure long-term support across multiple hospital departments to successfully implement an immediate postpartum LARC program. For programs to equitably serve all women in need of postpartum contraceptive care, champions and other program leaders need to implement strategies to address access issues. They should also explicitly focus on reproductive justice principles during program introduction and training. IMPLICATIONS: Successfully implementing immediate postpartum long-acting reversible contraception programs requires champions with institutional networking connections, administrative and nursing support, and clearly communicated goals. Champions need to address access issues and focus on reproductive justice principles during program introduction and training to equitably serve all women in need of postpartum contraceptive care.",20211108,108,,10.1016/j.contraception.2021.10.016,1879-0518,,

An example is the WHO health systems approach that connects people (needs, rights, perspectives) with services and technologies (equitable access, quality of care, mix of interventions) and with policies and institutional capacities (laws, regulations, human/physical resources, management and financing). The approach is comprehensive and multi-faceted, which is a strength. We argue, however, that health systems analyses should be supplemented with a focus on reproductive justice. Using the WHO health systems approach as an exemplar, we show how the reparative reproductive justice approach outlined by the first author and colleagues assists with outlining comprehensive remedies to the inequities identified in the systems analysis. We argue for attention to remedies at individual and collective, material and symbolic levels. We illustrate our argument using unsafe abortion, legal abortion services and post-abortion care in Lesotho as a case study.

Focus groups were conducted with clients and staff of a culturally-specific program that provides perinatal care for Black families. A thematic analysis was conducted using a Reproductive Justice framework as a guide. RESULTS: Participants consisted of 23 program clients and staff who all identified as Black women. Four themes emerged from the analysis: 1) The pervasive reach of structural racism, 2) Shared identities facilitate trust and healing, 3) Racism directly impacts mental health, and 4) Advocacy on macro and micro levels is a vital service.

This review uses a reproductive justice framework to systematically review empirical evidence of the indirect impacts of respiratory epidemics on SRH. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and CINAHL for original, peer-reviewed articles related to respiratory epidemics and women and girls' SRH through May 31, 2021. Studies focusing on various SRH outcomes were included, however those exclusively examining pregnancy, perinatal-related outcomes, and gender-based violence were excluded due to previously published systematic reviews on these topics. The review consisted of title and abstract screening, full-text screening, and data abstraction. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies met all eligibility criteria. These studies emphasized that COVID-19 resulted in service disruptions that effected access to abortion, contraceptives, HIV/STI testing, and changes in sexual behaviors, menstruation, and pregnancy intentions. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the need to enact policies that ensure equitable, timely access to quality SRH services for women and girls, despite quarantine and distancing policies. Research gaps include understanding how COVID-19 disruptions in SRH service provision, access and/or utilization have impacted underserved populations and those with intersectional identities, who faced SRH inequities notwithstanding an epidemic.

We aimed to visualise how intersecting power dynamics may operate in combination with HC use to increase or decrease subsequent use of antidepressants. Our main hypothesis was that the previously observed association between HC and antidepressants use would vary between strata, being more pronounced in more oppressed intersectional contexts. For this purpose, we applied an intersectional multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy approach. DESIGN: Observational prospective cohort study using record linkage of national Swedish registers. SETTING: The population of Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: All 915 954 women aged 12-30 residing in Sweden 2010, without a recent pregnancy and alive during the individual 1-year follow-up. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Use of any antidepressant, meaning being dispensed at least one antidepressant (ATC: N06A) during follow-up. RESULTS: Previously mentally healthy HC users had an OR of 1.79 for use of antidepressants compared with non-users, whereas this number was 1.28 for women with previous mental health issues. The highest antidepressant use were uniformly found in strata with previous mental health issues, with highest usage in women aged 24-30 with no immigrant background, low income and HC use (51.4%). The largest difference in antidepressant use between HC users and non-users was found in teenagers, and in adult women of immigrant background with low income. Of the total individual variance in the latent propensity of using antidepressant 9.01% (healthy) and 8.16% (with previous mental health issues) was found at the intersectional stratum level. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests teenagers and women with immigrant background and low income could be more sensitive to mood effects of HC, a heterogeneity important to consider moving forward.",20211002,11,10,10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049553,2044-6055,,

These online testimonials have been denounced as spreading ""hormonophobia"", i.e. an excessive fear of hormones based on irrational causes such as an overestimation of health risks associated with their use, that was already aroused by the recurring media controversies over hormonal contraception. In order to move toward a reproductive justice framework, we propose to study the arguments that women and men (as partners of female users) recently put forward against hormonal contraception to see whether they are related to hormonophobia. The aim of this article is to conduct a systematic review of the recent scientific literature in order to construct an evidence-based typology of reasons for rejecting hormonal contraception, in a continuum perspective from complaints to choosing not to use it, cited by women and men in Western countries in a recent time. The published literature was systematically searched using PubMed and the database from the French National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined). A total of 42 articles were included for full-text analysis. Eight main categories emerged as reasons for rejecting hormonal contraception: problems related to physical side effects; altered mental health; negative impact on sexuality; concerns about future fertility; invocation of nature; concerns about menstruation; fears and anxiety; and the delegitimization of the side effects of hormonal contraceptives. Thus, arguments against hormonal contraception appeared complex and multifactorial. Future research should examine the provider-patient relationship, the gender bias of hormonal contraception and demands for naturalness in order to understand how birth control could better meet the needs and expectations of women and men in Western countries today.",20210802,284,,10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114247,1873-5347,,

STUDY DESIGN: Respondents were self-identified women with criminal legal system involvement. Data come from a cross-sectional baseline survey of 381 women in three U.S. cities: Oakland, California, Kansas City, Kansas/Missouri, and Birmingham, Alabama. The primary outcome, high abortion-related knowledge, was based on a 10-item scale dichotomized into low vs high abortion-related knowledge. We used descriptive statistics, bivariable associations, and logistic regression to assess the association between high abortion-related knowledge, city of residence, and other possible related factors. RESULTS: Respondents in Kansas City, KS/MO and Birmingham, AL had lower odds of high abortion-related knowledge compared to respondents in Oakland, CA (OR: 0.19, 95% CI: 0.10-0.38 and OR: 0.17, 95% CI: 0.11-0.28, respectively).

The framework of Historical Oppression, Resilience and Transcendence (FHORT), Hill-Collins's concept of ""motherwork,"" and a framework of reproductive justice were used to frame the study and interpret findings. This critical ethnography included data from field notes, semistructured interviews, and focus groups. Reconstructive analysis, a specific type of thematic qualitative analysis for critical ethnographies, was used to interpret data. Participants from both tribes described themes related to the expectations and roles of mothers. These expectations included themes of (a) mothers as caretakers, (b) mothers as the centers of family and role models, (c) women to prioritize family over economic and educational aspirations, and (d) decolonizing norms for mothers. While historical oppression and patriarchal norms have constrained and regulated expectations for motherhood and the domestic roles of NA women, these findings also highlight how women decolonize these norms and find ways to reclaim their power through their roles as mothers.",20210716,36,3,10.1177/0886109920954409,0886-1099,,

Incorporating this knowledge into clinical practice may contribute to improving the quality of these services, especially in abortion care, in which loved ones are often excluded. The study took place in Northern California in 2014. We conducted semi-structured, intensive interviews with twenty cis-women about their birth and abortion experiences and analyzed their narratives with respect to accompaniment using grounded theory. The roles of loved ones were complementary yet distinct to those of medical personnel. They were also multifaceted. Participants needed familiar individuals to bear witness, share the emotional experience and provide protection from perceived or possible harm associated with medical care. In some cases, more often in the context of abortion than childbirth, participants shielded their loved ones from emotional burdens of the reproductive process. Some pregnant people of color faced gendered racism, which also influenced their accompaniment needs. Male partners played a distinct role of upholding dominant social ideals related to pregnancy. As is commonplace in birth-related care, abortion services could be formally structured to include partners, family members and friends when desired by pregnant people to improve their experiences. Such integration should be balanced with considerations for privacy, safety and institutional resources. Working toward this goal may reduce structural abortion stigma and help alleviate pregnant people's burdens associated with reproduction.",20210724,284,,10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114234,1873-5347,,

In Portugal, guidelines for intervention in SRH are insufficient, a gap that is more pronounced with migrant populations due to the absence of culturally sensitive indicators to assess and monitor SRH. The aim of this work was 2-fold: to identify good practices in the SRH field, with a particular focus, whenever possible, on migrant populations, and to identify relevant and inclusive indicators to monitor SRH in Portugal. A Delphi panel (via online survey) with 66 experts (researchers, teachers, and health professionals) and 16 stakeholders (non-governmental organizations, civil society, and governmental organizations) was implemented in two rounds. Panelists were asked to state their level of agreement (5-point Likert-type scale) regarding four different SRH areas: Sexual Health, Reproductive Health, Social-Structural Factors, and Good Practices.

We used a combination of deductive and inductive content analysis to categorize data. A concept map was generated using a reproductive justice framework. RESULTS: The data reflected three components of a reproductive justice framework: 1) women have limited access to healthcare in prison, 2) reproductive safety and dignity influence attitudes toward pregnancy and contraception, and 3) women in prison want better reproductive healthcare. Discrimination and stigma were commonly invoked throughout women's experiences in seeking reproductive healthcare.

Materials and Methods: We reviewed medical records of 690 individuals (23.9% Black; 93.6% women) who received a SA medical forensic exam (SAMFE) at a southeastern U.S. hospital. We examined bivariate racial differences in SA characteristics and used zero-inflated Poisson regressions to estimate racial differences in mental health outpatient visits at the SAMFE hospital. Results: Among survivors of SA, Black survivors were more likely than White survivors to have been victimized by an intimate partner (odds ratio [OR] = 1.77, confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.02-3.07) and they had more post-SA outpatient mental health visits at the SAMFE hospital (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.70-2.47). Black survivors were less likely to report alcohol or drug use before the SA (OR = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.28-0.62). In multivariable models, Black survivors trended toward more mental health visits than White survivors (IRR = 1.63, 95% CI = 0.82-2.44), but intimate partner violence (IPV) significantly moderated that association (IRR = 0.01, 95%CI = &#8804;0.001-0.03). Black survivors assaulted by an intimate partner were less likely to access mental health care than White IPV survivors. Conclusions: The hospital setting of a SAMFE could be a unique opportunity to serve Black survivors and reduce racial disparities in mental health sequelae, but additional support will be needed for Black survivors experiencing IPV.

While the outcomes of AMA pregnancies have been examined extensively, the drivers behind increasing rates of AMA pregnancies in the United States are less understood. Some scholars have asserted that women are increasingly delaying their first birth in favor of educational and career aspirations. Yet birth trends in the United States do not support this as the primary explanatory factor of AMA births. Other factors may also contribute to high rates of AMA in the United States. This study sought to identify main predictors of AMA birth using a cross-sectional retrospective sample. DESIGN: We employed a multivariate logistic regression analysis on a cross-sectional retrospective sample to identify significant independent predictors of giving birth at advance maternal age (AMA) in the United States. SETTING: Data was obtained from the Unites States Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) Phase 7 Core Questionnaire and linked birth certificates. Questions are designed to assess maternal attitudes and experiences before, during and just after pregnancy. Surveys for Phase 7 were completed in 2017 and 2018. The study population represents mothers from 34 states that met the CDC's 55% response rate threshold and Puerto Rico. PARTICIPANTS: The PRAMS dataset comprises self-reported data and linked birth certificate data from women who recently gave birth. A total of 38,549 mothers are included in the Phase 7 dataset. State sample sizes ranged from 503 mothers in Wyoming to 1,897 mothers in Michigan. All mothers gave birth in the year 2017. MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS: The outcome of interest was AMA birth, defined as conceiving and subsequently giving birth to a baby at age 35 or older. Predictors for AMA birth were selected a priori and included: pregnancy intention, history of previous live birth, insurance status, income, education, race/ethnicity, marital status, and urban location. Previous live birth to at least one child was a significant independent predictor for AMA birth. Mothers with high parity, defined as 6 or more previous live births, were 17 times more likely to give birth at advanced maternal age. Mothers with an unwanted pregnancy were 1.9 times more likely to have an AMA birth. College attainment, high income, marital status, urbanicity, and race/ethnicity were also independent predictors of AMA birth. Health insurance was not a significant predictor of AMA birth after accounting for other factors. KEY CONCLUSIONS: Delayed and late childbirth may not be intentional for a significant group of older mothers. Converse to popular assumptions that women delay childbearing in favor of career aspirations, the majority of AMA mothers have previous children. Half of AMA mothers have two or more previous children. The findings in this paper suggests that multiple factors predict AMA births. There may be several subtypes of women who enter pregnancy at advanced maternal age. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: As women weigh personal desire to bear children against competing social expectations, they may find themselves navigating their own unique path shaped in part by the region in which they live. Better characterization of the circumstances that lead to advanced maternal age in the United States, including exploration of unintended and unwanted AMA pregnancy, is necessary to develop policies and interventions that meet women's needs. This work should utilize a reproductive justice framework to ensure that women's preferences, particularly women of color, are upheld while promoting health and wellbeing for women.",20210404,98,,10.1016/j.midw.2021.102975,1532-3099,,

We used descriptive statistics to characterize attitudes towards medication abortion provision, including the belief that it is within their scope of practice and interest in future provision, and to explore perceived barriers to provision. We used logistic regression models to assess factors associated with each of these attitudes. RESULTS: Of 397 eligible attendings and trainees, 121 (30%) completed the survey. Among those surveyed, 44% believed medication abortion is within the scope of practice of IM PCPs with trainees and female-identifying providers being significantly more likely to believe medication abortion is within their scope of practice compared to attending physicians and male physicians (60% vs 30%, p < 0.01 and 53% vs 31%, p = 0.01, respectively).

The clinical, economical, and ethical implications of unintended pregnancy should prompt anesthesiologists to actively consider and manage this pharmacologic interaction. We surveyed anesthesiology providers at our institution about knowledge of this potential adverse drug interaction, how they manage it clinically, and the extent to which they involve patients in shared decision-making regarding choice of neuromuscular blocker antagonist. METHODS: A survey instrument was distributed to anesthesiology providers at a large, tertiary-care medical center. The survey explored prior experience using neostigmine and sugammadex, knowledge about potential sugammadex interference with hormonal contraception, pre-/postoperative counseling practices, clinical management, and shared decision-making regarding potential use of neostigmine in lieu of sugammadex to avoid this drug-drug interaction. RESULTS: Of 259 surveys distributed, 155 were fully completed, and 10 were partially completed. Overall response rate was 60% (residents 85%, student nurse anesthetists 53%, certified registered nurse anesthetists 58%, attendings 48%). All but 1 respondent recognized the potential for sugammadex interference with oral hormonal contraception. Far fewer accurately identified potential interference with hormonal intrauterine devices (44%) and hormonal contraceptive implants (55%). The manufacturer's recommended 7-day duration of alternative contraception was correctly identified by 72% of respondents; others (22%) reported longer durations (range 10-30 days). Most (78% overall) agreed/strongly agreed that potential interference with contraceptive effectiveness should be discussed with patients preoperatively. Despite the majority (86% overall) that endorsed shared decision-making and inviting patient input regarding choice between sugammadex and neostigmine, many respondents reported ""rarely/never"" having discussed this drug interaction with patients in actual clinical practice, either preoperatively (67%) or postoperatively (80%). Furthermore, most respondents (79%) reported ""rarely/never"" administering neostigmine to intentionally avoid this drug interaction. CONCLUSIONS: Two years after designating sugammadex as antagonist of choice, physician and nurse anesthesia providers reported seldom inquiring about contraceptive use among women of childbearing potential and rarely discussing potential risk of contraceptive failure from sugammadex exposure. Most lack accurate knowledge of sugammadex interference with hormonal intrauterine and subcutaneous contraceptive devices. Although most endorse preoperative counseling and support patient autonomy or shared decision-making regarding choice of reversal agent, the same respondents report rarely, if ever, actualizing these positions in clinical practice. These conflicting findings highlight the need for education regarding residual neuromuscular block versus adverse drug interactions, collaboration among providers involved in patient counseling, and intentional mindfulness of reproductive justice when caring for women of childbearing potential.",20210308,133,4,10.1213/ANE.0000000000005465,1526-7598,,

For many people around the world, infertility constitutes an emotional, social, and financial burden, yet appropriate services directed toward preventing and addressing infertility are often inaccessible, unaffordable, or nonexistent. With the impetus of a wider reproductive justice community, we call for the integration of infertility into global reproductive health research and practice, urging policy makers, practitioners, researchers, activists, and funders worldwide to bring focused attention to addressing challenges posed by a lack of safe, effective, and dignified fertility management among those in need.",20210203,104,3,10.4269/ajtmh.20-0128,1476-1645,,

Yet research suggests that, for young people, structural inequity is most influential in future outcomes, regardless of childbearing. We conducted in-depth interviews with 50 young women (ages 18-24) and their male partners (n = 100) and investigated the influence of structural inequity on pregnancy desires and plans. Three themes emerged, stratified by social advantage. In the ""Things Will Be Different Later"" theme, socially advantaged participants envisioned that their future lives would surely be different due to achievement of educational, professional, and economic goals; thus, their pregnancy plans aligned with their desires, often reflected in use of highly effective contraception. In the ""I Don't Have Everything I Need"" theme, participants expressed delaying desired pregnancies (primarily through condom use) until they could contend with structural barriers. Their pregnancy plans, shifted by way of structural inequity, were not aligned with their desires. Under the ""I'll Never Have Everything I Need"" theme, socially disadvantaged participants expressed significant doubt about ever realizing ideal circumstances for pregnancy preparedness; as pregnancy prevention was not salient, these participants used condoms or no contraception. This analysis indicates that structural inequities constrain reproductive self-determination in emerging adulthood, creating a chasm between desired and actual childbearing that was reflected in contraceptive decision-making. Public health narratives emphasizing the importance of pregnancy prevention for socially disadvantaged groups without addressing the manifestation of structural inequity in their lives perpetuate reproductive oppression vis-à-vis emphasis on contraceptive use to ensure future economic success.",20210129,50,6,10.1007/s10508-020-01854-0,1573-2800,,

This tiered model outlines all forms of birth control but recommends long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC) to eliminate user error and increase continuation. Our critical discourse analysis of gynecology textbooks and medical recommendations examines how gendered and neoliberal ideas influence risk assessments underlying the tiered contraceptive counseling model. Specifically, we explore how embodied, lifestyle, and medical risks are constructed to prioritize contraceptive failure over adverse side effects and reproductive autonomy. We find that the tiered model's focus on contraceptive failure is justified by a discourse that speciously conflates distinct characteristics of pharmaceuticals: efficacy (ability to produce intended effect) and safety (lack of unintended adverse outcomes). Efficacy discourse, which filters all logic through the lens of intended effect, magnifies lifestyle and embodied risks over medical risks by constructing two biased risk assessments. The first risk assessment defines ovulation, menstruation, and pregnancy as hazardous (i.e., embodied risk); the second insinuates that cisgender women who do not engage in contraceptive self-management are burdensome to society (i.e., lifestyle risk). Combined, these assessments downplay side effects (i.e., medical risks), suggesting that LARC and other pharma-contraceptives are worth the risk to protect cisgender women from their fertile bodies and to guard society against unintended pregnancy. Through this process, ranking birth control methods by failure rates rather than by side effects or reproductive autonomy becomes logical as efficacy is equated with safety for cisgender women and society. Our analysis reveals how technoscientific solutions are promoted to address social problems, and how informed contraceptive choice is diminished when pharma-contraceptives are framed as the most logical option without cogent descriptions of their associated risks.",20210118,270,,10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113547,1873-5347,,

METHODS: We conducted semi-structured, qualitative interviews of 17 women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes from Michigan, USA. Participants were recruited from a diabetes registry and local clinics. We adapted domains from the Health Belief Model (HBM) and applied reproductive justice principles to inform the qualitative data collection and analysis.

Results: The literature review identified high rates of contraception underutilization and negative attitudes toward pregnancy among WICJ in a wide variety of settings. WICJ described minimal access to reproductive health services, including evidence-based contraception, and experienced high rates of unplanned and undesired pregnancies. Results were interpreted in the context of the reproductive justice (RJ) framework. Conclusions: The CJS, although not designed to provide health care, should dedicate resources to address the multilevel barriers to care experienced by women.

However, midwives can also be found engaging in inadvertent activism on a daily basis within routine care. When casting a feminist lens over both the content and context of midwifery practice in Australia, subversive acts and opportunities for feminist reform can be found. AIM: To interrogate the significance of feminism in midwifery practice, identifying feminist successes and further opportunities for implementation including: analysis of the Midwifery Standards for Practice; the primary tenets of woman-centred care; the content versus context of midwifery in Australia; and feminist opportunities for enhanced practice. This paper will discuss the importance of feminism in midwifery practice and its significance in informing optimal midwifery care. DISCUSSION: Incorporating women's voice and respecting women's bodies and agency in the delivery of care is a fundamental component of midwifery practice. However, while the content of midwifery practice is innately feminist in its emphasis on woman-centred care, it will be argued that the context of birthing in Australia is not. The resultant effect is the emergence of victim blaming in maternity care and the construction of an archetypal 'good birthing woman'. IMPLICATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Moving away from the myth of the 'good birthing woman' and the act of victim blaming, midwifery could instead direct its focus towards challenging the rigid systems and structures within which midwives implement care.

First, it argues that, while both the right to gender identity and the right to sexual and reproductive health are part of the indivisible core of human rights, in practice trans people are forced to choose between them. Understanding this scenario requires focusing on the eugenic dimensions of trans policies, even in states where the recognition of a gender identity other than that assigned at birth is not tied to surgical or hormonal compromises. The concept of ""passive eugenics"", coined over twenty years ago by James Bowman, offers a valuable key in this respect. Second, the paper highlights some factors that hinder a successful approach to the reproductive health and rights of trans people. These factors include: the normative imageries about the reproductive capacities and desires of trans people, representations about pregnancy and ""womanhood"", and the form taken by identity politics in contemporary feminist movements. The attention given as a priority (if not exclusively) to initiatives for the legalisation of voluntary abortion, understood as a right pertaining to (cis) women, offers a significant example of these difficulties.

I then examine whether socioeconomic disadvantage has an association with contraceptive switching or discontinuation. I demonstrate that socioeconomic disadvantage decreases the chance of selecting any IUD, while Black racial membership increases the chance of selecting the 3-month injectable and Multiracial membership increases the chance of selecting the Vaginal Ring. I then demonstrate that socioeconomic disadvantage and self-identified race have intersectional and variable associations with switching, and, to a lesser extent, discontinuing methods. These findings offer an important insight for implementation in contraceptive programs: eliminating financial barriers to access contraceptive services does not eliminate the socioeconomic contexts that influence method selection and use that occur as part of everyday lived experiences.

RESULTS: We interviewed thirty obstetrician-gynecologists (63.3% women, 76.7% non-subspecialized, and 53.3% academic setting). Participants largely described the consent form as unnecessary, paternalistic, an administrative hassle, a barrier to desired patient care, and associated with worse health outcomes. Views on the waiting period's utility and impact were mixed. Many participants felt the sterilization policy was discriminatory.

CONCLUSION: Many physicians shared concerns about the ethics and clinical impact of the Medicaid sterilization policy. Future revisions to the Medicaid sterilization policy must balance prevention of coercion with reduction in barriers to those desiring sterilization in order to maximize reproductive autonomy. IMPLICATIONS: Obstetrician-gynecologists are key stakeholders of the Medicaid sterilization policy. Obstetrician-gynecologists largely believe that revision to the Medicaid sterilization policy is warranted to balance reduction of external barriers to desired care with a process that enforces the need for counseling regarding contraception and reviewing patient preference for sterilization throughout pregnancy in order to minimize regret.",20200829,102,5,10.1016/j.contraception.2020.08.009,1879-0518,,

Many participants faced barriers to receiving a prescription, including time, transportation, cost, stigma, embarrassment, and clinician refusal based on religious reasons. Participants believed OC OTC would improve women's control over their fertility and emphasized the importance of health insurance coverage for OC OTC. Some participants expressed concerns about the risk of side effects, contraindications, and the potential for abuse. Some participants believed women, especially adolescents, required physician guidance and an annual exam to use OC.

The review is based on the analysis of 39 articles, which belong to a range of different disciplines (mostly sociology, social psychology, anthropology, ethnology, and gender studies). The number of interviews in each study range from as few as seven to over one hundred. Countries covered include Australia, Canada, Greece, India, Iran, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Norway, Russia, Sweden, UK, Ukraine, and the USA. Most studies focus only on surrogacy practices in one country (although often with intended parents from other countries), and some include several countries (e.g. interviewees from several countries or fieldwork in different field-sites). The proposed typology goes beyond the division between altruistic versus commercial, and traditional versus gestational surrogacy, in order to inform further research and to contribute to bioethical and policy debates on surrogacy in a transnational context. Four types of relations are identifiable: open, restricted, structured, and enmeshed. The criteria which influence these relationships are: the frequency and character of contact pre- and post-birth; expectations of both parties; the type of exchange involved in surrogacy arrangements; and cultural, legal, and economic contexts. The theoretical contribution of the article is to further the development of a relational justice approach to surrogacy.",20200220,125,2,10.1080/03009734.2020.1725935,2000-1967,,

In contrast to interventions using liberal rights-based approaches, we advocate the use of a 'marketplace of options' since access to sexual and reproductive health services is very limited for poor girls and not evenly distributed. Moreover, while poverty and unequal gender relations render girls vulnerable to sexual coercion and violence, the criminal justice system is often weak, leaving victims powerless.

The possibility of full ectogenesis remains hypothetical at present, and myriad concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of the technology must be evaluated and addressed, while pressing moral considerations should be fully deliberated. However, it is conceivable that the technology may become sufficiently well established in the future and that eventually full ectogenesis might be deemed ethically acceptable as a reproductive alternative to gestation within a human womb under certain circumstances. If the safety and efficacy of full ectogenesis are established, if ethical dilemmas are sufficiently well addressed, and if the technology is offered as a reproductive option to cisgender heterosexual individuals or couples desiring to become parents, there is a moral obligation grounded in social justice to ensure that full ectogenesis be made available to individuals or couples identifying as members of sexual- or gender-minority groups who likewise seek to pursue parenthood. We examine the history of access to current family-building options, including assisted reproductive technology, surrogacy and adoption, for these populations and conclude that in the absence of robust empirical evidence suggesting an increased risk of harm to children of individuals and couples who identify as members of sexual- or gender-minority groups, equitable access to ectogenesis as a pathway to parenthood for sexual and gender minorities must be assured as a matter of reproductive justice.",20200213,34,4,10.1111/bioe.12723,1467-8519,,

In the United States, physicians have been complicit in multiple historical reproductive injustices, involving coercive sterilization of thousands of people of color, low income, and disabilities. Currently, reproductive injustices continue to occur; however, physicians have no formal RJ medical education to address injustices. The objective of this study was to engage leading advocates within the movement using a Delphi method to identify critical components for such a curriculum. Approach: In 2016, we invited 65 RJ advocates and leaders to participate in an expert panel to design RJ medical education. A 3-round Delphi survey was distributed electronically to identify content for inclusion in an RJ curriculum. In the next 2 survey rounds, experts offered feedback and revisions and rated agreement with including content recommendations in the final curriculum. We calculated descriptive statistics to analyze quantitative data. A team with educational expertise wrote learning outcomes based on expert content recommendations. Findings: Of the 65 RJ advocates and leaders invited, 41 participated on the expert panel of the Delphi survey. In the first survey, the expert panel recommended 58 RJ content areas through open-ended response. Over the next 2 rounds, there was consensus among the panel to include 52 of 58 of these areas in the curriculum. Recommended content fell into 11 broad domains: access, disparities, and structural competency; advocacy; approaches to reproductive healthcare; contemporary law and policy; cultural safety; historical injustices; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, and intersex health; oppression, power, and bias training; patient care; reproductive health; and RJ definitions. The 97 learning outcomes created from this process represented both unique and existing educational elements. Insights: A collaborative methodology infused with RJ values can bridge experts in advocacy and academics. New learning outcomes identified through this process can enhance medical education; however, it is just as important to consider education in RJ approaches to care as it is knowledge about that care. We must explore the pedagogic process of RJ medical education while considering that expertise in this area may exist outside of the medical community and thus there is a need to partner with RJ advocates. Finally, we expect to use innovative teaching methods to transform medical education and achieve an RJ focus.",20190712,32,1,10.1080/10401334.2019.1631168,1532-8015,,

Background: Motherhood among Roma girls (RGM) in Europe impoverishes their lives, puts them at risk of poor physical and mental health and precipitates school dropouts. Overwhelming evidence affirms that the conditions of poverty and the social exclusionary processes they suffer have a very important explanatory weight in their sexual and reproductive decisions. Methods: Through a Community-based Participatory Action Research design, 20-25 Roma girls will be recruited in each one of the four impoverished communities in Bulgaria, Romania and Spain. Data collection and analysis: Desk review about scientific evidences and policies will be carried out to frame the problem. Narratives of Roma women as well as baseline and end line interviews of girl participants will be collected through both qualitative and quantitative techniques. Quantitative data will be gathered through reliable scales of mattering, socio-political agency, satisfaction with life and self. A narrative analysis of the qualitative information generated in the interviews will be carried out. Expected results: (1) uncover contextual and psychosocial patterns of girl-motherhood among Roma women; (2) build critical thinking among Roma girls to actively participate in all decisions affecting them and advocate for their own gender rights within their communities; and (3) empower Roma girls and their significant adults to critically evaluate their own initiatives and provide feedback to their relevant stakeholders. Conclusions: Roma girls will improve their educational aspirations and achievements and their social status while respecting and enhancing Roma values.",20210209,17,22,10.3390/ijerph17228498,1660-4601,,

The purpose of this paper was to synthesize the key results and findings presented by members of the FP community at the 2018 ICFP Conference. Methods More than 700 abstracts from all 15 conference tracks were reviewed and 64 abstracts total were selected for this paper based on the novelty and urgency of the findings. The content analysis of conference abstracts were grouped into six final thematic areas. Results 1 ) Investing in family planning for a lifetime of returns. FP continues to face a shortage of funding. Domestically based and locally owned funding models provide alternative financing solutions. 2) Addressing inequities in family planning for key populations. Various populations still face challenges in accessing FP. Youth-inclusive and user-centered programming show promise in addressing such challenges. 3) Reproductive justice, Unsafe abortions tend to be more common among younger, poor, uneducated and rural women. Legislation is still needed to facilitate a culture of safe abortions. 4) Couple dynamics and decision-making. Couples who share equitable responsibility in decision-making processes are more likely to use contraceptives; couple disagreement influences women's decisions to covertly use FP. 5) Male involvement in  programming. Male champions can successfully promote uptake of FP. Gender-transformative programming promotes gender equity and impacts behavior change. 6) Breakthroughs in novel contraceptives and systems improvement in family planning. Recent advances include user-centered contraceptive technologies that allow for self-administration and information systems which optimize supply chain management. Conclusion The research, advocacy, and programmatic abstracts at ICFP 2018 highlighted research advances, showcased implementation science wins, and provided evidence of critical knowledge gaps in global FP access and use.",20210311,4,,10.12688/gatesopenres.13130.2,2572-4754,,

We explored the utility of minimally invasive AMH as a measure of fecundability in population-based reproductive health research. METHODS: We analyzed baseline data from 191 participants in a pilot, longitudinal cohort study, the Young Women's Stress Study. Using an integrated biosocial design, we collected interviewer-administered surveys on demographic, psychosocial, health, and method feasibility/acceptability information and finger-stick capillary dried blood spots (DBS). We used descriptive and bivariate statistics (correlation, T-tests, ANOVA) to estimate method feasibility/acceptability and unadjusted AMH mean concentrations overall and across sociodemographic, reproductive, and health covariates. RESULTS: AMH concentrations ranged from 1.02 to 22.23 ng/mL, with a mean of 5.66 ng/mL. AMH concentrations were associated with current hormonal contraceptive use, menstrual cycle frequency, and irregular menstrual patterns, but not with other known correlates. Most participants stated the DBS method was comfortable (81%) and would be likely to provide it again (88%). CONCLUSIONS: While these pilot data suggest AMH fell within normal range and our DBS methods were acceptable/feasible, the broader question of its usefulness for population reproductive health research remains unanswered. Larger, longitudinal studies are needed to validate AMH against time-to-pregnancy and gold standard measures in young healthy samples and across different sociodemographic groups. Public health and social scientists should consider the resource costs of AMH, ethical issues, and risks of (over)interpretation, with a reproductive justice and human rights frame in mind.",20210917,5,1,10.15761/fwh.1000177,2398-2799,,

On April 11, 2019, South Korea's Constitutional Court ruled that the ban on abortion was unconstitutional. As a result, South Korea's legislature must revise the 66-year-old anti-abortion law by December 31, 2020. This historic decision was closely related to the advocacy of a number of feminist groups, doctors' organizations, disability rights groups, youth activists, and religious groups in South Korea, who collectively formed the Joint Action for Reproductive Justice (Joint Action) in 2017. This paper describes the activism and actions of Joint Action as a key part of reproductive justice movements in Korea. Joint Action was initiated by an organization for women with disabilities, and once formed, they worked collectively to frame abortion as a social justice issue that goes beyond the pro-choice versus pro-life binary. By focusing on the composition, strategies, and main agenda of Joint Action, this paper analyzes how Joint Action influenced the Constitutional Court's 2019 decision to decriminalize abortion in South Korea and how the court established that it is the government's responsibility to ensure every individual's reproductive health and rights.",20191231,21,2,,2150-4113,,

Both nursing programs serve vulnerable groups of expectant and new parents who grapple with challenges to health and well-being stemming from structural racism. As reflective capacities are supported within the consultation case conferences, providers spontaneously identify the need for tools to effectively address issues of race, class, and culture and to combat structural racism throughout the healthcare system. Policies and procedures that uphold structural racism cease to be tolerable to providers who bring their full selves to the work that they are trained to do. Using these nurse consultation partnerships as organizational case studies, this article describes a range of challenges that arise for providers and delineates steps to effective engagement toward reproductive justice.",20190711,40,5,10.1002/imhj.21807,1097-0355,,

We utilized data from an existing study that consisted of a partnership with a Latino community in Michigan in which an immigration raid resulted in multiple arrests and deportations midway through data collection. Using cross-sectional survey data (n = 192) where no one was re-interviewed, we used ordinal logistic regression to compare desired pregnancy timing of individuals surveyed prior to and after the raid to determine the impact of an immigration raid on desired timing of next pregnancy. We then used qualitative data-including 21 in-depth interviews and participant observation-collected in the community after the raid to contextualize our findings. Controlling for socio-demographic characteristics, we found that Latinos surveyed in the aftermath of the raid were more likely to report a greater desire to delay childbearing than Latinos surveyed before the raid occurred. Our qualitative data showed that an immigration raid has financial and psychological effects on immigrant families and that a raid may impact reproductive autonomy because people are fearful of these impacts. These finding suggest that current immigration enforcement efforts may influence reproductive decision-making, impede Latinos reproductive autonomy, and that family-friendly immigration policy reform is needed.",20190605,14,6,10.1371/journal.pone.0217898,1932-6203,,

HPV infection has been linked to more than 90% of cervical cancers. A vaccine to prevent the acquisition of HPV has been available since 2006. The purpose of this study was to investigate women's perceptions of cervical cancer prevention, including HPV vaccination. A reproductive justice framework guided data collection and analysis. In 2016, researchers conducted 70 in-depth, semi-structured qualitative interviews with women aged 19-78 years in South Carolina. A purposive sampling approach was employed to maximize requisite variety based on social, economic, and environmental axes of inequality. Participants self-identified as white (53%), African American (33%), and Hispanic (9%). Data analysis included an inductive constant comparative method to identify patterns and themes across the interviews. Misinformation about the prevalence and risk of HPV and cervical cancer led to ""othering"" of women with HPV-related diagnoses based on the flawed assumption of not being at risk. Participants described a lack of knowledge about the effectiveness and safety of the HPV vaccine. Social norms influenced participants' perceptions of HPV vaccination and cervical cancer, including concerns about sexual activity and intergenerational communication. Participants' social construction of identity, including race/ethnicity, socioeconomic position, ability, age, gender, sexual orientation, and immigration status, impacted their perceptions of cervical cancer screening and the HPV vaccine. In particular, participants believed that the HPV vaccine was ""only for girls"" and identified gender norms that limited uptake. Participants described barriers to accessing health care and cervical cancer screening, including cost, health insurance, and life changes (e.g., pregnancy, relocating).

METHOD: This is a descriptive study in which in-depth interviews and discussion groups were held with all programme professionals, including a documentary review of the programme. The information was analyzed based on the Roma Health Integration Policy Index, a tool that evaluates the entitlement, accessibility, sensitivity and capacity for change of health programmes for the Roma population. RESULTS: The professionals encountered multiple challenges to implement the family planning programme with Roma women due to the characteristics of the users and the low sensitivity of the programme towards them. The absence of specific actions for Roma women within the family planning programme, agreed to by the healthcare district, obliges professionals to develop adaptations and strategies to ensure quality sexual and reproductive health services for their users. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to adapt sexual and reproductive health programmes targeted at Roma women by (a) detecting, evaluating, systematizing and disseminating good practices, (b) developing actions that address the multiple vulnerabilities of Roma women, (c) acknowledging professionals who advocate for the health of these women within their organizations, and (d) promoting reproductive justice as the goal of these programmes.",20180410,33,3,10.1016/j.gaceta.2017.12.006,1578-1283,,

In this paper, I propose the use of a supportability reparative justice approach. Drawing on intra-categorical intersectionality, the supportability aspect starts from the event of a pregnancy to unravel the interwoven embodied and social realities implicated in women experiencing pregnancy as personally supportable/unsupportable, and socially supported/unsupported. The reparative justice aspect highlights the need for social repair in the case of unsupportable pregnancies and relies on Ernesto Verdeja's critical theory of reparative justice in which he outlines four reparative dimensions. Using abortion within the South African context, I show how this framework may be put to use: (1) the facilitation of autonomous decision-making (individual material dimension) requires understanding women within context, and less emphasis on individual-driven 'choice'; (2) the provision of legal, safe state-sponsored healthcare resources (collective material dimension) demands political will and abortion service provision to be regarded as a moral as well as a healthcare priority; (3) overcoming stigma and the spoiled identities (collective symbolic dimension) requires significant feminist action to deconstruct negative discourses and to foreground positive narratives; and (4) understanding individual lived experiences (individual symbolic dimension) means deep listening within the social dynamics of particular contexts.",20180404,21,1,10.1080/13691058.2018.1447687,1464-5351,,

METHODS: The authors conducted a prospective observational cohort study of women who gave birth over an 8-month period and requested immediate postpartum sterilization. Records of women with unfulfilled requests were reviewed up to 3 months postpartum to determine rates of postpartum follow-up and interval sterilization. Primary analysis examined unfulfilled sterilization requests associated with the Medicaid consent form and, secondarily, all other reasons for unfulfilled requests, as well as alternative contraceptive methods chosen. RESULTS: Of the 334 women who requested immediate postpartum sterilization, 173 (52%) received the requested sterilization and 161 (48%) did not. Among those whose request was unfulfilled, 91 (56.5%) still wanted the procedure, and of those women, more than two-thirds were unable to receive it because of Medicaid consent issues. Within this group, only 6 received interval sterilization by 3 months postpartum; more than one-third received a form of long-acting reversible contraception, and 24.6% did not receive postpartum care. DISCUSSION: A sizable proportion of women requesting postpartum sterilization have unfulfilled requests because of an issue with the Medicaid consent and also have a low likelihood of receiving interval sterilization by 3 months postpartum. The Medicaid consent may create barriers for women requesting postpartum sterilization, the vast majority of whom face subsequent barriers obtaining interval sterilization, thereby increasing the risk for unintended pregnancy in an at-risk population. This has important implications for reproductive justice efforts to protect vulnerable populations while minimizing barriers to desired care.",20181110,64,2,10.1111/jmwh.12909,1542-2011,,

Pregnant women and their infants, are vulnerable to the impact of this vector-borne illness (mosquito) and sexually transmitted viral infection. The uncertainty surrounding the possibility of congenital anomalies due to ZIKV infection during pregnancy bring a renewed debate about the rights of women to control their reproductive decisions. Current strategies, resources and services aimed at prevention priorities fall short of responding to a clear framework regarding sexual reproductive health, rights and justice. A comprehensive approach to reproduction, in times of Zika, needs to empower women of reproductive age and their families to make decisions and to act on those decisions. This paper highlights the contributions of the Maternal-Infant Studies Center (CEMI-Spanish Acronym) in close collaboration with the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the University of the Puerto Rico School of Medicine and the University Hospital in providing comprehensive health care to pregnant women with ZIKV or at risk of ZIKV, at the very onset of the epidemic. CEMI approaches the care of pregnant women from a reproductive justice perspective, integrating clinical services, education, research, and advocacy. Transformación Prenatal (Centering Group Prenatal Care, GPC) currently implemented at the Puerto Rico University Hospital High Risk Clinics has been pivotal to achieve this aim.

Mass incarceration, then, disrupts conventional modes of reproduction and threatens reproductive justice, separates families and funnels children into foster care, diverts funds from social services into prisons, restricts women's access to abortion and adequate pregnancy care, shackles women in childbirth, and incarcerates people during their prime reproductive years. Beyond these obvious disruptions to reproduction, incarceration also cultivates certain ways of being a parent. Much of the critical literature on mass incarceration focuses on men, largely because of fewer women and masculinist assumptions of the carceral system. This paper looks specifically at how women's reproduction is experienced and managed by carceral institutions, and how mass incarceration itself is a reproductive technology. Based on ethnographic fieldwork at a women's jail, I explore pregnancy and motherhood behind bars. Certain types of mothering are foreclosed, while an idealized version of maternal identity is simultaneously promoted. For many incarcerated women, jail is the only place where they can experience this form of motherhood, as forces of structural violence outside of jail often limit their ability to parent, such as involvement of child welfare institutions, addiction and homelessness. The myriad ways in which incarcerated women's reproduction is suppressed and enabled is a critical lens through which to understand how institutions and forces of racial oppression reinforce idealized notions of motherhood while making them categorically unattainable.",20190212,7,,10.1016/j.rbms.2018.10.018,2405-6618,,

This vantage point of egg providers can help lend important insights into the wider processes of family-making across borders today. It centres on ethnographic research conducted on contemporary cross-border egg provision performed by female migrant workers in Spain. Through this intersectional perspective, we stand to gain deeper insights into cross-border reproduction more widely. Egg provision can be a way for migrant women to gain temporary financial benefit. In a system that does not provide equal access for migrants to work and care, female migrants make themselves extractable commodities. As such, they are both a commodity and a worker at the same time. The example of female migrant workers providing eggs can be used to reflect more generally on egg provision, and on cross-border reproduction and reproductive justice models as used in queer cross-border family-building. Taken within the broader framework of reproductive justice, and with the struggles of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender cross-border reproduction in mind, the paper begins by asking how three intersecting inequalities due to (1) migration/citizenship, (2) joblessness/contract working and (3) race facilitate the industry of cross-border reproduction? In what ways do female migrant workers mobilize their reproductive potential, including time, whiteness, other racial/phenotypic similarity to commissioning parents, and unstable work lives in cross-border egg donation? The paper ends with an argument for focusing analytical and political attention on the needs of those providing eggs; the most prized material resources for cross-border reproduction.",20190216,7,,10.1016/j.rbms.2018.10.020,2405-6618,,

I offer a queer reproductive justice (QRJ) framework that joins the shift in feminist politics from advocating safe, affordable and equitable access to ART to imagining other ways of doing and making kinship, care and children. QRJ suggests that kinship can be queered via choice and ART without succumbing to either a binary choice between queerness and normativity or without being unaccountable to oneself, others within systems of power, and the very systems that make our choices legible. QRJ neither marginalizes nor valorizes LGBTQ desires and practices for inclusion in reproductive biomedicine, and refuses to renaturalize or valorize certain forms of reproduction over others. Instead, QRJ posits queer kinship as a social formation that variously challenges and reinforces the values of neoliberal, future-oriented reproductivity and the global biological market economies in which these increasingly take shape.

My analysis informs conversations in medical anthropology on moral decision-making around reproduction and on local dynamics of resistance to reproductive governance.

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTIONS: Using a mixed-method design, we conducted 30 in-person interviews with adolescent LARC users who were enrolled in school-based health centers in New York City. Interviews were conducted in 2 phases: during phase 1, 12 participants viewed a pilot version of the app (MyLARC); during phase 2, 18 additional participants interacted with an expanded version of the app. Phase 2 participants downloaded MyLARC onto their smartphone and app usage was tracked. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants' responses to the in-person interviews and data usage of MyLARC from phase 2 determined the feasibility and acceptability of using MyLARC to support young women's satisfaction and continuation of LARC methods. RESULTS: Noneducational games were recommended as an approach to provide information to adolescents in an engaging way, as well as educational graphics and visually appealing content. Data tracking of MyLARC usage among phase 2 participants revealed a total of 67 unique logins to the app with 18 average page visits per unique login.

Racial and ethnic disparities in adolescent pregnancy rates continue to exist, as do state-based differences in pregnancy, birth, and abortion rates. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists supports access for adolescents to all contraceptive methods approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In the absence of contraindications, patient choice should be the principal factor in prescribing one method of contraception over another. Dual method use-the use of condoms in combination with more effective contraceptive methods to protect against sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancy-is the ideal contraceptive practice for adolescents. Just as adolescents should have access to the full range of contraceptives, including long-acting reversible contraceptive methods, they should be able to decline and discontinue any method on their own, without barriers. A reproductive justice framework for contraceptive counseling and access is essential to providing equitable health care, accessing and having coverage for contraceptive methods, and resisting potential coercion by health care providers.

Despite positive trends, the United States continues to have the highest adolescent pregnancy rate among industrialized countries with data. Racial and ethnic disparities in adolescent pregnancy rates continue to exist, as do state-based differences in pregnancy, birth, and abortion rates. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists supports access for adolescents to all contraceptive methods approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In the absence of contraindications, patient choice should be the principal factor in prescribing one method of contraception over another. Dual method use-the use of condoms in combination with more effective contraceptive methods to protect against sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancy-is the ideal contraceptive practice for adolescents. Just as adolescents should have access to the full range of contraceptives, including long-acting reversible contraceptive methods, they should be able to decline and discontinue any method on their own, without barriers. A reproductive justice framework for contraceptive counseling and access is essential to providing equitable health care, accessing and having coverage for contraceptive methods, and resisting potential coercion by health care providers. Successful programs that resulted in measurable changes in adolescent contraceptive practices and sexual behavior have been described, but not implemented uniformly nor supported by policy improvements. More research is needed to determine which programs are most effective and which programs do not work.

Sterilization practices have embodied a problematic tension, in which some women who desired fertility were sterilized without their knowledge or consent, and other women who wanted sterilization to limit their family size lacked access to it. An ethical approach to the provision of sterilization must, therefore, promote access for women who wish to use sterilization as a method of contraception, but at the same time safeguard against coercive or otherwise unjust uses.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We obtained publicly available data on state-only public funding for family planning and abortion services (years available: 1980, 1987, 1994, 2001, 2006, and 2010) and corresponding annual data on US county infant death rates. We modeled the funding as both fraction of state expenditures and per capita spending (per woman, age 15-44). State-level covariates comprised: Title X and Medicaid per capita funding, fertility rate, and percent of counties with no abortion services; county-level covariates were: median family income, and percent: black infants, adults without a high school education, urban, and female labor force participation. We used Possion log-linear models for: (1) repeat cross-sectional analyses, with random state and county effects; and (2) panel analysis, with fixed state effects. RESULTS: Four findings were robust to analytic approach. First, since 2000, the rate ratio for infant death comparing states in the top funding quartile vs. no funding for abortion services ranged (in models including all covariates) between 0.94 to 0.98 (95% confidence intervals excluding 1, except for the 2001 cross-sectional analysis, whose upper bound equaled 1), yielding an average 15% reduction in risk (range: 8 to 22%). Second, a similar risk reduction for state per capita funding for family planning services occurred in 1994. Third, the excess risk associated with lower county income increased over time, and fourth, remained persistently high for counties with a high percent of black infants. CONCLUSIONS: Insofar as reducing infant mortality is a government priority, our data underscore the need, despite heightened contention, for adequate public funding for abortion services and for redressing health inequities.",20160726,2,,,2352-8273,,

This project aimed to identify core competencies to guide SRH training across the primary care professions. STUDY DESIGN: A six-member interprofessional expert working group drafted SRH competencies for primary care team members. Primary care providers including family physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners and certified nurse midwives, physician assistants and pharmacists were invited to participate in a three-round electronic Delphi survey. In each round, participants voted by email to retain, eliminate or revise each competency, with their suggested edits to the competencies incorporated by the researchers after each round. RESULTS: Fifty providers from six professions participated. In Round 1, 17 of 33 draft competencies reached the 75% predetermined agreement level to be accepted as written. Five were combined, reducing the total number to 28. Based on Round 2 feedback, 21 competencies were reworded, and 2 were combined. In Round 3, all 26 competencies reached at least 83.7% agreement, with 9 achieving 100% agreement. CONCLUSION: The 33 core competencies encompass professional ethics and reproductive justice, collaboration, SRH services and conditions affecting SRH. These core competencies will be disseminated and adapted to each profession's scope of practice to inform required curricula. IMPLICATIONS: SRH competencies for primary care can inform the required curricula across professions, filling the gap between an established standard of care necessary to meet patient needs and the outcomes of that care.",20160116,93,5,10.1016/j.contraception.2015.12.013,1879-0518,,

From a relatively narrow discipline focused on regulating relationships among individual patients, health care providers, and third-party payers, it is expanding into a far broader field with a burgeoning commitment to access to health care and assurance of healthy living conditions as matters of social justice. Through a series of incremental reform efforts stretching back decades before the Affordable Care Act and encompassing public health law as well as the law of health care financing and delivery, reducing health disparities has become a central focus of American health law and policy. This Article labels, describes, and furthers a nascent ""health justice"" movement by examining what it means to view health law as an instrument of social justice. Drawing on the experiences of the reproductive justice, environmental justice, and food justice movements, and on the writings of political philosophers and ethicists on health justice, I propose that health justice offers an alternative to the market competition and patient rights paradigms that currently dominate health law scholarship, advocacy, and reform. I then examine the role of law in reducing health disparities through the health justice lens. I argue that the nascent health justice framework suggests three commitments for the use of law to reduce health disparities. First, to a broader inquiry that views access to health care as one among many social determinants of health deserving of public attention and resources. Second, to probing inquiry into the effects of class, racial, and other forms of social and cultural bias on the design and implementation of measures to reduce health disparities. And third, to collective action grounded in community engagement and participatory parity. In exploring these commitments, I highlight tensions within the social justice framework and between the social justice framework and the nascent health justice movement. These tensions illustrate, rather than undermine, the power of viewing health law as social justice. They raise important questions that should prompt more fruitful and rigorous thinking within health law activism and scholarship and with regard to the relationships between law and social justice more broadly.",20160128,24,1,,1069-0565,,

The relevant question is not how to rid science of values but, instead, to ask which values and whose values belong? Currently, antiabortion values consistently determine US research policy. Abortion research is declared illegitimate in covert and overt ways, at the level of individual researchers and research policy broadly. Most importantly, federal policy impedes conduct of both basic and clinical research in abortion. However, it is not just research in abortion that is deemed ""illegitimate;"" research in infertility and in vitro fertilization is as well. Federal funding of any reproductive health research agenda that would pose more than minimal risk to a fetus or embryo is banned. This leaves unanswered scientific questions about abortion, infertility, miscarriage and contraception among other areas. Since moral ground is occupied not just by abortion opponents but also by people who support abortion rights, there is at the very least a competing moral claim to consider changing federal research funding policy. Women and families deserve access to knowledge across the spectrum of reproductive health issues, whether they seek to end or start a pregnancy.

Smith, the first welfare case heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, overturned the Alabama substitute father law. Such laws directed or allowed welfare officials to use the sexual behavior and reproductive capacity of poor African American women to alienate this population from ""cash-money""; to reassert political and bureaucratic control over the intimate relationships of African Americans, demonstrating that this population was unprepared for civil rights and full citizenship; and to shore up white supremacy in the civil rights era. The context for this case which originated in Selma, Alabama in 1966 illustrates that even if poor African American women had had access to contraception and legal abortion at that time, they would still have lacked reproductive autonomy and dignity as the state surveilled their sexual behavior and enforced laws making sex, itself, as well as reproduction, and the right to define their own intimate relationships and families, a race and class privilege.",20100923,22,3,,1042-7961,,

Ross helped build a women's health movement that by the late 1980s made the demands of women of color central. This movement was attractive to many women of color who had rejected the collapse of a broader women's health movement into the abortion rights movement as too narrowly focused. Many women of color activists, including Ross, argued that the emphasis on abortion rights and choice failed to address the linked socioeconomic and community health issues confronted by many women of color and poor women. Ross's work spurred coalition building among white women and women of color that focused on expanding reproductive justice and women's health beyond legal abortion. By the 1990s these efforts had produced a vibrant and engaged feminist reproductive justice movement that promoted the socioeconomics of good health for all women.",20100923,22,3,,1042-7961,,

Participants share a fetal-centered logic that US-funded biomedicine must shoulder the burden of rescuing sub-Saharan Africa from itself by using the bodies of HIV-positive pregnant women to transmit biomedicine's magic bullet­antiretroviral drugs­to the next generation. The survival of the fetus, disguised as the well-being of the HIV-positive woman and accomplished by the magic of biomedical research, becomes the survival of a region otherwise doomed by its present state of economic, political, and medical incapacity. This version of what queer theorist Lee Edelman (2004, No Future: Queer Theory and the Death Drive) calls ""reproductive futurism"" redounds to the benefit of the more explicitly women-hating and nationalist ideologies of still-powerful right-wing movements against reproductive and sexual rights.",20100909,17,3,,1072-4745,,
