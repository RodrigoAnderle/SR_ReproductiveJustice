Today, public institutions and social services have been established by the state to police and surveil the behavior of poor communities and parents to maintain the reproductive violence and oppression that began centuries ago. This paper uses a reproductive justice framework to explore how the history of criminalizing pregnancy, surveilling Black and Indigenous communities, and denying reproductive autonomy are connected to and maintained by the present-day family policing system. In doing so, this paper expands on existing literature to create a stronger link and build solidarity between the movements against family policing and reproductive oppression. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {For centuries, the reproductive agency of women with disabilities have been challenged and often undermined by informal and formal support networks. Evidence illustrates that women with disabilities face disproportionately higher rates of reproductive violence compared to their nondisabled peers (i.e., long-term contraception or forced sterilization). However, little is known about the specific nature, type, and impact of reproductive violence on women with disabilities. This scoping review examined the literature related to the reproductive violence against women with disabilities. We used Arksey and O Malley s framework, and based on our inclusion criteria, 28 empirical articles were included. Most studies were published in the disciplines of health (i.e., nursing and medicine) within the North American context and used qualitative research designs. Main findings within the scoping review included themes related to imposed contraception, rationalization of sterilization, barriers to sexual and reproductive health services, and the discourses underpinning reproductive injustice toward women with disabilities. The findings of the study have implications for future disability community-based research, peer-led supports, practice guidelines for professionals, and intersectoral policy provision aiming at supporting the reproductive agency of women with disabilities. © 2024 American Psychological Association Inc..

	abstract = {This article is a response to the new wave of legal changes restricting access to abortion in several countries across the world, which have substantially undermined the global advances in the field of reproductive rights observed in recent years. To address this problem, the article derives insights from two important bodies of literature that are usually perceived as theoretically and ideologically counterposed, namely feminist legal studies and systems theory. In juxtaposing two important academic literatures, the article exposes gaps in both, and it demonstrates the conceptual potentials inherent in this juxtaposition. The article engages with the work of Drucilla Cornell and Gunther Teubner, who – despite their very different intellectual backgrounds – provided progressive interpretations of systems theory. It further critically examines whether societal constitutionalism can help feminists explain the recent developments in abortion law across the world. It engages critically with Teubner’s arguments concerning the role that human rights play in constraining the expansive tendencies of social systems, such as politics and religion, revealing the limitations of Teubner’s arguments in relation to reproductive rights and justice. At the same time, the article helps restate the contemporary relevance of systems-theoretical approaches in atypical fields like reproductive justice and gender studies. © 2024 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.},

	abstract = {Background: Chilean midwives have been identified as essential for successfully implementing an abortion law, a practice which could potentially be understood as contradicting their central mission. Nevertheless, to date, there has been no investigation into how Chilean midwives have incorporated induced abortion care provision into their professional identity. Objective: To elucidate how Chilean midwives understand and provide abortion care and how they have (re)defined their professional identity to include induced abortion care. This article reports the findings of the second part of this aim. Methods: This study was underpinned by a constructivist grounded theory methodology informed by a reproductive justice and feminist perspective. Midwives from Chile who have cared for women undergoing abortion were invited to participate in the study. After purposive and theoretical sampling, fifteen midwives were recruited. Findings: Midwives’ identity is woman-centred, with high value placed on their role protecting life. These two aspects of midwives’ identity are in contradiction when providing abortion care. Midwives’ identity results from and informs midwives’ practice. Midwifery regulation influences both practice and identity. The model ‘Navigating a maze’ explains the interaction of these three elements. Conclusion: Midwives’ identity response to the enactment of the Chilean abortion law is an example of how professional identity must navigate regulation and practice to make sense of its purpose. In light of this study's findings, the current tension experienced in midwives’ identity should be carefully attended to prevent adverse outcomes for midwives and the Chilean population. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {In the United States, access to contraception and abortion care is limited by policy makers aligned with conservative religious positions, which are often specifically Catholic or Evangelical Christian. In this post-Roe political climate, activists, policy makers, voters, and everyday individuals are responding to the loss of legal authority over one’s body. This article analyzes fertility awareness methods, contraceptive practices also known as “natural family planning.” I explore the feminist health history of fertility awareness methods to enhance body knowledge and how these methods differ from the Catholic Church’s antiabortion position promoting natural family planning. This study is based on materials collected from the 1960s to the present on fertility awareness methods and natural family planning from feminist, Catholic, and global public health perspectives. I selected the 1960s due to the confluence of social changes: the organizing of a feminist health movement, the marketing of the contraceptive pill, and shifts in Catholic teachings. By charting the multiple meanings of fertility awareness methods, I highlight their potential as a full-body health strategy that can withstand multiple challenges to sexual and reproductive care. In line with reproductive justice goals, fertility awareness methods assist both those who are trying not to conceive and those who are trying to conceive, and unlike mainstream contraceptive technologies, they build networks of people practicing fertility awareness. Although fertility awareness methods are controversial because some feminist health advocates interpret them as undermining support for all contraceptives and aligning with an antiabortion agenda, I advocate for a visible, dynamic, inclusive feminist framing of these methods. © 2024 The University of Chicago.

Stratified reproduction – rewarding motherhood for some and disempowering others from being parents – and its relation to ableism is explored in a country context, where reproductive rights struggles are prevalent in the public sphere. Based on qualitative empirical research (in-depth semi-structured interviews and focus group interviews) with 50 women with disabilities, the article shows that women with disabilities are subjected to mechanisms of social control that limit their reproductive decision-making and discourage them from becoming parents. Social control is explored in the context of withdrawal of information about reproductive health and sexuality, navigating access and fear of custody deprivation based on ableist presumptions. The ambivalence between social expectations related to parenthood versus performing care work is explored. The analysis shows that women with disabilities navigate exclusionary norms and challenge understandings of who can become a parent and who can make decisions about who can become a parent. This article offers the concept of stratified reproduction to explain the structural inequalities experienced by women with disabilities with regard to reproduction, and highlights the importance of studying ableism as an essential factor within the reproductive realm. © The Author(s) 2024.},

As abortion rights mobilized both feminists and a conservative opposition, the agenda and rhetoric of PP had to expand and adjust accordingly. This project explores the ways PP’s mission and the political terrain in which it operated became more complicated in this decade, focusing on the strategies it adopted to survive. There is much to be learned from how the organization sought to weather the unique tensions experienced by the legalization of abortion, the energy of the women’s movement, and the emerging backlash against perceived liberal excesses as it navigated the often oppositional demands of being both a service provider and advocate. As abortion access enters a new era of vulnerability and contestation, the role of PP remains uncertain. In exploring a key moment in the organization’s past, we also ponder the role of PP in the Dobbs era and whether it has either the capacity or political will to serve its constituents given its complicated history and still complicated present. © 2023 SAGE Publications.},

A secondary objective is to identify and map the measures used to evaluate the efficacy of these types of support and services. INTRODUCTION: Pregnant and parenting women and their children experiencing complex challenges related to the social determinants of health, including unstable housing and poverty, are at high risk of long-term negative health and socioeconomic outcomes. Maternity residences may provide support and services that improve this population's outcomes; however, there is little understanding of what services are offered and how efficacious they may be. Therefore, it is necessary to provide a comprehensive overview of support and services in maternity residences, and to identify the measures used to evaluate the efficacy of the support and services. This will provide the foundation to evaluate these services and outcomes and inform the development of future maternity residential programs. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Studies including pregnant and parenting women and gender-diverse individuals who are housed in, or accessing the services of, maternity residences in politically stable high-income countries due to challenges rooted in the social determinants of health will be considered for inclusion. We define maternity residences as any agency with a residential component offering support/services to this population. METHODS: This review will be conducted in accordance with JBI methodology for scoping reviews. The data will be analyzed using a quantitative descriptive analysis approach. The data analysis and discussion will be informed by the Social Determinants of Health, Reproductive Justice, Harm Reduction, and Health in All Policies frameworks. Copyright © 2023 JBI.},

The question is divisive even among Protestants themselves. Protestants ostensibly agree on the centrality of Biblical Scripture for ethics, but Scripture's meaning has never been self-evident. Other factors-namely tradition, reason, and experience-condition our readings. After decades of getting no closer to theological agreement, and in the wake of the 2022 repeal of Roe v.

Instead, we should focus our limited time and energy on creating systemic conditions for reproductive justice and engaging in concrete practices of hospitality and neighbor love. © Oxford University Press 2024.

Methods: We conducted an online survey of individuals ages 18 to 50 in the United States who had previously used and discontinued or attempted to discontinue LARC. We recruited respondents using the Amazon platform MTurk. Respondents provided demographic information and answered questions regarding their experience discontinuing LARC, including reasons removal was deferred or denied. We analyzed frequency of types of barriers encountered and compared these by demographic factors. Results: Of the 376 surveys analyzed, 99 (26%) described experiencing at least one barrier to removal. Barriers were disproportionately reported by those who had public health insurance, a history of abortion, and a history of birth compared to those who did not report barriers to removal. They also more frequently identified as Latinx, Asian, or Middle Eastern. Most barriers were provider-driven and potentially modifiable. Conclusions for Practice: Barriers to LARC discontinuation are common and may be provider- or systems-driven. Providers should be mindful of biases in their counseling and practices to avoid contributing to these barriers. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.},

Particularly sensitive is access to sexual and reproductive health care services (SRHS). Yet, while there has been substantial conceptual work to conceptualize autonomy (e.g., as independence), there is a lack of empirical research that documents the perceptions of adolescents regarding on how they access or wish to access health care services. The main objectives of this research were to (a) understand how adolescents in Colombia interpret the concept of “autonomy,” (b) describe how these adolescents articulate their autonomy (i.e., preferences) in accessing SRHS, and (c) analyze the ethical issues emerging from these data. Forty-five semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants aged 14 to 23 years old in the Departments of Antioquia and Valle del Cauca in Colombia. Our study showed that participants’ understanding of autonomy was context-based and highly dependent on personal experiences, and these influenced their choice in how to access SRHS. Seen through the ethical lens of a reproductive justice framework, our results highlight the unequal opportunities for adolescents in terms of autonomy to access SRHS. © The Author(s) 2021.},

We linked publicly available data on neighborhood eviction filing and judgment rates to preconception and during-pregnancy addresses from the Life-course Inf luences on Fetal Environments (LIFE) Study (2009-2011; n = 808). Multinomial logistic regression–estimated odds of MPD and SPD during pregnancy that were associated with eviction filing and judgment rate trajectories incorporating preconception and during-pregnancy addresses (each categorized as low, medium, or high, with two 9-category trajectory measures). Psychological distress was measured with the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6) (K6 scores 5-12 = MPD, and K6 scores ≥13 = SPD). MPD was reported in 60% of the sample and SPD in 8%. In adjusted models, higher neighborhood eviction filing and judgment rates, as compared with low/low rates, during the preconception and pregnancy periods were associated with 2- to 4-fold higher odds of both MPD and SPD during pregnancy among African American women. In future studies, researchers should identify mechanisms of these findings to inform timely community-based interventions and effective policy solutions to ensure the basic human right to housing for all. © The Author(s) 2024.},

Sections 312-318 of the Indian Penal Code, along with the POCSO Act and the PCPNDT Act, compose this criminal framework, promoting state surveillance that intimidates abortion providers and seekers alike. Legal cases vividly illustrate the harmful “chilling effect” on both healthcare providers and abortion seekers resulting from criminalization. The stigma linked to criminalized abortions constrains reproductive decisional autonomy compelling individuals to choose between safe but prosecutable procedures, unsafe abortions with health risks, or carrying undesired pregnancies to term. This disproportionately affects marginalized communities, underscoring the inadequacy of carceral approaches in addressing structural barriers to realisation of reproductive rights. Advocates call for complete decriminalization, pushing for a transition to a reproductive justice framework. The proposal to completely abolish penal provisions that govern forced abortions begets concerns about leaving marginalized pregnant persons who frequently experience forced abortions with no legal recourse. This feminist dilemma that ensues requires the adoption of decarceral, intersectional approaches that maintain structures of accountability, without posing any risk to the rights of marginalized pregnant persons. © 2024, Onati International Institute for the Sociology of Law.

Social safety is a health-relevant resource found in environments communicating safety, connectedness, inclusion, and protection. Approaches promoting social safety may be particularly relevant to preventing adverse perinatal health outcomes among Black women. However, there remains a lack of conceptual clarity. The purpose of this concept analysis was to provide a theoretical clarification of the concept social safety for Black women within perinatal health care. Methods: PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL were searched using Boolean search strategy. Retrieved articles were managed in Zotero. Duplicates were removed, and each article was assessed and categorized by both investigators. Articles reporting Black women's perinatal health care experiences were included. Thematic analysis guided by Rodgers’ evolutionary method identified defining attributes, antecedents, and consequences of social safety in perinatal care for Black women. Results: Social safety for Black women is defined as the process of feeling understood, respected, cared for, and in control in perinatal health care settings that make space, care for, and recognize strengths, thereby cultivating safety and empowerment. Discussion: Social safety offers actionable insights for practice and research that have the potential to drive positive change in perinatal care delivery for Black women. Developing interventions and measurements that are valid, reliable, and reflect social safety are essential to promote positive experiences and equity in health care practices and policies. © 2024 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.},

	abstract = {Background: Fertility centre websites are a key sources of information on medically assisted reproduction (MAR) for both infertile people and the general public. As part of a global fertility market, they are also a window to attract potential future patients. They give formal and practical information but in the way the information is displayed, they also convey social representations, and in particular, gender representation in its intersectional dimension. The objective is to analyse the sex, class and race representations regarding reproduction and parenthood that are embedded in the content of fertility centre websites in eight European countries. Methods: The 5 most visible fertility centres that appeared in the first places on Internet search were selected for each country under study, except for one country which has only three fertility centres. In total, 38 fertility centre websites were considered for a thematic analysis using an iterative approach and a comprehensive perspective. Results: Each centre details its services and techniques according to the legal provisions in force in its country. However, on all the websites studied, the fertility centres demonstrate a strong gendered representation. The logos generally depict women or parts of their bodies, as do the photos, which mainly show white women with light eyes. The description of the causes of infertility and the techniques offered by the centres also highlights gender differences. Sperm donation, where MAR is reserved for heterosexual couples, is included among the techniques for women with the comment that it will enable them to fulfil their dream of becoming mothers. Conclusions: MAR, and through it the project of having a child and procreative work, is presented as a matter for white, cisgender and heterosexual women, thus fueling stratified reproduction and limiting reproductive justice. The research team formulated guidelines for fertility centres to encourage them to adopt a more inclusive approach in terms of sex, social class and race, so that the diversity of infertile people feel involved and welcome in these centres, to avoid misperceptions about infertility in the general population and to reinforce autonomy and justice in reproductive matters. © The Author(s) 2024.},

It highlights altar work and community collaboration as important pedagogical tools for liberatory education. The article points to various practices that both blur the lines between past and present while simultaneously transgressing traditional classroom boundaries and asking collaborators to collectively envision new reproductive futures. It highlights two projects, the Reproductive Justice Community Altar (RJCA) and Community Herbal Gathering (CHG), to highlight the utility of these transformative pedagogical tools. © 2024, University Library System, University of Pittsburgh.

I identify three conceptual frames within which Shelby situates his analysis—feminization, choice-as-control, and moralization. I argue that these frames should be rejected on conceptual, empirical, and moral grounds. As I show, this framing engenders a flawed understanding of poor black women’s procreative lives. I propose an alternative framework for reconceiving the relationship between poverty and procreative justice, one oriented around reproductive flourishing instead of reproductive responsibility. More generally, the paper develops a methodological challenge for nonideal moral and political philosophy, especially concerning the obligations of the oppressed. Specifically, I argue that in the absence of descriptive and conceptual accountability, the moral gaze of the philosopher risks preserving, rather than destabilizing, oppressive ideologies. © The Author(s), 2022.},

On the other hand, media coverage of Dobbs primed students—particularly those who had not been exposed to reproductive justice—to think about abortion access in isolation from other topics and from an exclusively U.S. perspective. In this article, I discuss my experience teaching the Politics of Reproduction in Fall 2022. Among other goals, I wanted to expose students to La Marea Verde, or the “Green Wave,” of countries expanding abortion access in Latin America. By teaching Latin American abortion politics in relation to the Dobbs decision, I aim to disrupt U.S. hegemony. Specifically, teaching about the Green Wave highlights the possibility of organizing for reproductive justice outside the parameters of the state and challenges the logic of American Exceptionalism, which works to justify and normalize intersectional inequalities. © 2024, Centre d'Etudes Mongoles et Siberiennes.

We conducted focus groups and interviews with 80 individuals with lived experience of infertility and/or LGBTQ+ family formation in the US, two intersecting groups of potential IVG users. Respondents expressed hope that IVG would lead to higher reproductive success than current assisted reproductive technology (ART), alleviate suffering associated with ART use, and promote greater social inclusion, while expressing concerns predominantly framed in terms of equity and safety. These findings underscore the importance of sustained engagement with stakeholders with relevant experience to anticipate the implications of IVG for research and clinical translation. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {This book will address and uncover the role of US Christian Right 'pro-family' groups in mobilizing counter-movements against LGBTIQ+ human rights, reproductive justice, and sexuality education in Africa, and will intervene in the tendency to exceptionalize Africa as a 'homophobic continent' following the surge in homophobic and transphobic legislation, hate speech, and violence in recent years. The author employs the lens of decoloniality in an intersectional manner to unpack the multiple forms of hierarchy and oppression that the concept of the nuclear family has historically worked to naturalize in the interests of capitalism, Christo-normativity, and a world system dominated and controlled by the global north. Proceeding from the historical geopolitical context informing nuclear family idealization, the analysis then presents a critical discussion of contemporary pro-family discourses, showing that pro-family narratives that universalize and politicize the notion of 'family' arenot only constituting agendas that erode LGBTIQ+ and reproductive justice, but reinforce an international order that privileges Euro-American interests despite pro-family claims that their agendas are anti-imperialist. This book will be of interest to scholars in gender, sexuality, and queer studies; postcolonial studies; and international relations. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

	abstract = {Place and the intergenerational transmission of cultural knowledge are deeply intertwined among Indigenous groups due to the significance of the environment and land within Indigenous ideologies, and the legacies of displacement wrought by settler colonialism. Little research explores this topic among Indigenous tribes in the Gulf South, who face unique environmental challenges related to climate change, land loss, oil extraction, and who depend on the coastal environment for cultural and subsistence resources. Scholarship on this topic among tribes that are not federally recognized is similarly limited. Using semi-structured interviews among 31 self-identified women members of a U.S. Gulf South tribe, we show how gendered and place-based knowledges manifest within the embodied and material experiences of tribal members, as well as the ways that those experiences and the transmission of knowledge are mediated by political and environmental changes through the example of traditional health and healing practices and knowledges. Key findings that emerged include: (a) Place-Based Concerns about Environmental Change and Displacement; (b) Concerns about Future Generational Changes in Knowledge Transmission; (c) Loss of Indigenous Health Knowledge. We suggest that there are significant impediments to the sociocultural reproduction of traditional health and healing practices and knowledges within the tribe brought about by environmental changes (e.g. saltwater intrusion, land loss, etc.) and the continuing influx of Western medicinal knowledge and practices. In contextualizing these findings within the environmental reproductive justice framework, we echo extant intersectional environmental research suggesting that environmental degradation and legacies of settler colonialism, by virtue of place-based and gendered knowledges and labor, disproportionately burden women, especially Indigenous women. We also note that despite significant material and cultural threats, tribal members demonstrate resilience and resistance to the macro-scale forces obstructing Indigenous ways of life. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {Throughout all areas of medical practice, genetic counselors (GCs) occupy a key position in promoting patients' personal autonomy while facilitating informed medical decision-making. This professional position aligns with the concept of reproductive justice. Previous literature has attempted to define reproductive advocacy in medicine as well as the potential intersection of genetic counseling and reproductive justice advocacy work, yet limited data exist regarding GCs' perceptions of their role and involvement in reproductive justice advocacy work. This study aimed to identify the perceptions and actions of GCs regarding reproductive justice advocacy measures, as well as explore motivating factors influencing their attitudes and behaviors. Family planning providers, who tend to prioritize reproductive justice and advocacy, were surveyed to be a comparison group. We distributed an anonymous online survey within the National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) and the Society of Family Planning (SFP) consisting of a 10-item personality inventory and Likert scale questions exploring characteristics and behaviors regarding reproductive justice advocacy. Results from 252 eligible respondents were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Chi-square, and Mann–Whitney U analyses. NSGC members are significantly less involved in several areas of reproductive justice advocacy, including regular participation in advocacy efforts when compared to SFP members (p = 0.04). The most cited barrier to NSGC members' participation was feeling unsure how to become involved, a significant difference compared to SFP members (p = 0.01). Findings from this study, undertaken in the final days of Roe v. Wade, suggest that GCs want to be more involved in reproductive justice advocacy but are uncertain where to begin. Intersociety collaboration and intra-society promotion of grassroots reproductive justice efforts may reduce this perceived barrier and others like it. © 2023 National Society of Genetic Counselors.},

Washington, DC, a microcosm of structural inequities in the United States, has persistent racial disparities in perinatal outcomes and housing insecurity. Methods: Grounded in a reproductive justice framework, we explored the lived experience of navigating homelessness assistance while pregnant to inform recommendations for a collaborative policy and practice change effort. We conducted 20 individual interviews with DC residents who experienced homelessness during pregnancy. We analyzed the data using thematic analysis and an action-oriented approach. Results: Our analysis resulted in three main recommendation areas for policy and practice change: (1) timely and meaningful access to safe and stable housing in pregnancy; (2) care coordination for services and referrals that support physical, mental, and social well-being; and (3) access to a living wage and affordable housing. Discussion: Access to stable housing is critical to ensure that pregnant and parenting people can have and raise children in a safe and sustainable environment—key tenets of reproductive justice. Housing support must be meaningfully accessible, including service delivery that accommodates the complex social histories and competing demands that accompany housing insecurity. Health Equity Implications: This study informed the development of strategic recommendations, catalyzed a new model for multisector collaboration, and influenced a system-wide practice change to expand access to robust housing supports for pregnant people. Policy and practice change require sustained leveraging of political will to promote economic justice and ensure that residents can achieve safe, sustainable, and affordable housing. ©Christina X.

The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stands firmly in its support of comprehensive sexuality education and re-emphasizes the importance of the implementation of scientifically accurate, age-appropriate, culturally relevant, and inclusive education. Successful implementation relies on active youth leadership, physician involvement, and a renewed focus on high-quality monitoring mechanisms to assess impact and accountability at all levels. Most importantly, future efforts to improve and scale comprehensive sexuality education must emphasize the importance of an inclusive curriculum that addresses previously marginalized youth, such as LGTBQ+ and disabled individuals, through a reproductive justice lens. FIGO commits, and encourages the international healthcare community, to provide continued advocacy for the rights to health, education, and equality, in order to achieve improvement in health outcomes for young people across the globe. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Introduction: From 2013 to 2019, Black women comprised 73% of pregnancy-related deaths in Philadelphia. There is currently a dearth of research on the continuity of midwifery care from initiation of prenatal care through birth in relation to characteristics such as race/ethnicity and income. The aim of this study was to investigate whether race/ethnicity and insurance status were associated with the likelihood of a pregnant person who begins prenatal care with a midwife to remain in midwifery care for birth attendance. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of a diverse population of pregnant patients who gave birth in a large tertiary care hospital and had their first prenatal visit with a certified nurse-midwife (CNM) between June 2, 2009, and June 30, 2020 (n = 5121). We used multivariable, log-binomial regression models to calculate risk ratios of transferring to physician care (vs remaining within CNM care), adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, prepregnancy body mass index, insurance type, and comorbidities. Results: After adjusting for pregnancy-related risk factors, non-Hispanic Black patients (adjusted relative risk [aRR], 1.14; 95% CI, 1.04-1.24) and publicly insured patients (aRR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01-1.22) were at higher risk of being transferred to physician care compared with non-Hispanic White and privately insured patients. Secondary analysis revealed that non-Hispanic Black patients had higher risk of transferring and having an operative birth (aRR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.18-1.55), whereas publicly insured patients were at higher risk of being transferred for reasons other than operative births (aRR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.18-1.54). Discussion: These findings indicate that Black and publicly insured patients were more likely than White and privately insured patients to transfer to physician care even after adjustment for comorbid conditions. Thus, further research is needed to identify the factors that contribute to racial and economic disparity in continuity of midwifery care. © 2024 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.},

	abstract = {Feminist scholars of reproductive justice argue for a broader model of politics organised around embodied experience. But to fully express the intersectional politics of reproductive justice, more attention must be given to the social function of embodiment—the ways that bodily markers create associative communities among strangers. This shared form of embodiment establishes connections that exceed the intimate relationship of a specific pregnancy. In particular, foetal embodiment manifests via communities with vested interest in the social meaning of life. These communities are affected, albeit indirectly, by reproductive choices and are therefore valid subjects of concern for reproductive justice. I develop the argument by focusing on disability, a specific form of embodiment where control over reproductive life is exercised not merely via state regulation of choice but also through social reproduction of normality. Engaging with foetal embodiment poses genuine risks—given popular arguments that link coercive regulations to the idea of ‘foetal personhood’. But these risks must be faced if reproductive justice is to be a truly intersectional project. © 2024 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Following the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision, Republican-controlled legislatures across the U.S. initiated draconian abortion restrictions. In order to appeal to anti-abortion policymakers, advocates across the country have strategically separated “maternal and child health” (MCH) issues, such as increased insurance coverage for midwifery and doula care, from issues often labeled as “reproductive rights,” such as access to sex education, birth control, and abortion. Advocates point out this strategic separation has likely contributed overall to the downfall of abortion rights. In this paper, we analyze legislative discourse to understand the legislative challenges advocates face, the strategic separations and allyships they employ, and the implications for other states and reproductive health more broadly. We find that legislators legitimate the same scientific evidence in some contexts while not in others in order to hold onto rhetorical purity within the abortion debate. In their attempts to parse the ideal abortion seeker, conservative legislators create legal ambiguities with serious consequences for healthcare. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {High stress experienced during pregnancy increases risk for adverse birth outcomes such as low birthweight and preterm birth that occur disproportionately among women of color in the United States. Prior research has identified a distinct form of discrimination, gendered racism in pregnancy (GRiP), that likely elevates stress and is suspected to contribute to racial disparities in birth outcomes among American women. We investigated associations of GRiP experiences and distress with two types of stress, pregnancy related and pandemic related, among 2,995 pregnant women in the United States at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, a time when health care restrictions, social contact limitations, and concerns about COVID-19 infection created added stress for pregnant women. Using data collected online during the second US pandemic surge (December 2020), we found that pregnant self-identified Hispanic/Latina (n = 233), Non-Hispanic/Latina Black/African American (n = 182), and Multiracial/Other (n = 201) women experienced greater GRiP and greater stress of both types than Non-Hispanic/ Latina White women. Structural equation modeling indicated a strong association of racial/ethnic identity with prenatal stress that was mediated by GRiP, independent of other contributors to prenatal stress. Focusing on the harmful impact of gendered racism coupled with culturally informed individual interventions and change at multiple societal levels and institutions may help reduce the poorer reproductive outcomes that are disproportionately common among communities of color in the United States. Addressing and alleviating discrimination can improve reproductive justice for all who choose to give birth throughout the world, regardless of their race, ethnicity, nationality, or other identities. © 2024 American Psychological Association Inc..

Jackson court ruling (heretofore adverse reactions), psychological distress, collective action, and abortion history among cisgender women and people assigned female at birth. Specifically, we examined the ways in which the relation between adverse reactions to the Dobbs v. Jackson decision and psychological distress may vary according to involvement in reproductive justice and antiabortion collective action and abortion history. Results (n = 894) revealed that adverse reactions were significantly positively related to psychological distress. Furthermore, involvement in reproductive justice collective action was significantly positive to psychological distress whereas the relation between antiabortion collective action and psychological distress was nonsignificant. The positive relation between adverse reactions and psychological distress was exacerbated by high levels of involvement in reproductive justice and weakened by low levels of involvement in antiabortion collective action, and these relations did not vary according to abortion history. In addition, the relation between involvement in antiabortion collective action and psychological distress was significant and positive among those who had had an abortion and nonsignificant for those who had not. These findings reveal the importance of mental health providers attending to their clients’ abortion-related beliefs and histories, involvement in collective action, and psychological distress.

	abstract = {This article theorizes the reproductive dimensions of racial capitalism. It begins by bringing into conversation Black Marxist theories of racial capitalism and Marxist feminist theories of social and biological reproduction proffered by Cedric Robinson and Silvia Federici respectively. It demonstrates that since its inception, racial capitalism has depended on processes of racialized (re)productive accumulation that are ongoing but not yet fully theorized. At the center of the essay is a close reading of Hortense Spillers’s 1987 contribution “Mama’s Baby, Papa’s Maybe: An American Grammar Book.” Though Spillers is not generally regarded as either a Black Marxist or a Marxist feminist, the essay argues that she ought to be recognized as a theorist of racialized (re)productive accumulation—a process that begins aboard the slave ship, persists on the plantation, and endures into the present. Racialized (re)productive accumulation exploited she whom Spillers often denotes as “the captive female,” and, also, paradoxically, ungendered her. Ultimately, through examination of the process of ungendering in Atlantic slavery, the essay suggests that Spillers opens up new ways to think about the history of racial capitalism, (re)productive dispossession, and the possibility of its refusal. The article concludes by considering how Spillers’s complex insights about the process of ungendering might yet be mobilized to secure truly substantive forms of reproductive justice. © 2024 Duke University Press.

	abstract = {Perinatal mental illness is a leading cause of death during pregnancy and the first postpartum year in the United States. Although better acute care services for mental health conditions are desperately needed, urgent services alone cannot create the conditions to thrive. Cultivating well-being requires a sustained commitment to reproductive justice, “the human right to maintain personal bodily autonomy, have children, not have children, and parent the children we have in safe and sustainable communities.” To support reproductive justice for pregnant and birthing people, the Rippel Foundation’s Vital Conditions for Health and Well-Being framework offers a holistic approach comprising seven domains: a thriving natural world; basic needs for health and safety; humane housing; meaningful work and wealth; lifelong learning; reliable transportation; and, central to all of these, belonging and civic muscle. Here we review the evidence for each of the vital conditions as key drivers of perinatal mental health, and we outline how this public health approach can advance well-being across generations. © 2024, Project HOPE.

By using a participatory approach, this methodological article analyses an Empowerment Evaluation experience within the European RoMoMatteR project. This project, which focuses on the notion of reproductive justice, has involved a group of Roma girls from Alicante (Spain), in a context characterized by discrimination based on ethnicity, gender and age, as well as by structural determinants such as social exclusion. The main research objective has been to analyse the relevance of the methodology designed to assess how project participants have developed a sense of autonomy and the acquisition of socio-cultural resources as assets for their future life choices. Therefore, the study design has followed the model proposed by Fetterman for Empowerment Evaluation: establishing a mission to be assessed, participatory diagnosis of the current status and finally planning for the future to start the desired change. Fetterman's model was adapted by designing and organizing participatory workshops with the girls involved in the project. The results confirm the relevance of the methodological proposal of the workshops to engage aspects of empowerment. The findings also allow to detect the empowerment of the Roma girls especially in two areas of the project: reaching the proposed objectives and the methodology used to register significant information. In the first case, the results show that Roma girls' establish a critical perspective on the idea of reproductive justice, and related to this, the activation of proactive behaviours linked to the acquisition of socio-cultural resources in the development of visions of their personal futures. In the second case, the Roma girls have also shown empowerment in decision-making on technical aspects, methodological design and taking action aimed at the collective construction of useful information in the project. © 2023 The Authors.

To illustrate how these rhetorics of infertility operate within broader neoliberal and racialized discourses, we critically consider three themes: first, we contend that fertility issues should become theorized through reproductive justice theory, particularly as class/race/nation divides donors from recipients, through forms of capitalistic endeavor as a rational enterprise; second, we review how “infertility” has become rhetorically important in the U.S. cultural milieu in critical communication and cultural studies; and finally, we argue that donor rhetorics represent a form of neoliberalism situated within racial/ethnic able-bodied eugenics and an inability to conceive, which results in emotional, physical, and financial cost to the self and society. © 2023 SAGE Publications.},

	abstract = {In the realm of global health policy, the intricacies of power dynamics and intersectionality have become increasingly evident. Structurally embedded power hierarchies constitute a significant concern in achieving health for all and demand transformational change. Adopting intersectional feminist approaches potentially mitigates health inequities through more inclusive and responsive health policies. While feminist approaches to foreign and development policies are receiving increasing attention, they are not accorded the importance they deserve in global health policy. This article presents a framework for a Feminist Global Health Policy (FGHP), outlines the objectives and underlying principles and identifies the actors responsible for its meaningful implementation. Recognising that power hierarchies and societal contexts inherently shape research, the proposed framework was developed via a participatory research approach that aligns with feminist principles. Three independent online focus groups were conducted between August and September 2022 with 11 participants affiliated to the global-academic or local-activist level and covering all WHO regions. The qualitative content analysis revealed that a FGHP must be centred on considerations of intersectionality, power and knowledge paradigms to present meaningful alternatives to the current structures. By balancing guiding principles with sensitivity for context-specific adaptations, the framework is designed to be applicable locally and globally, whilst its adoption is intended to advance health equity and reproductive justice, with communities and policymakers identified as the main actors. This study underscores the importance of dismantling power structures by fostering intersectional and participatory approaches for a more equitable global health landscape. The FGHP framework is intended to initiate debate among global health practitioners, policymakers, researchers and communities. Whilst an undeniably intricate and time-consuming process, continuous and collaborative work towards health equity is imperative to translate this vision into practice.  © 2024 Eger et al.

This study tests whether mass incarceration is associated with infant mortality and low birthweight across U.S. counties, and whether maternal vulnerability explains the relationship between mass incarceration and birth disparities. Methods: Data were derived from a variety of public sources and were merged using federal FIPS codes. Outcomes from the CDC Vitality Statistics include percent low birth weight births (births below 2499 g divided by singleton births to women aged 20 to 39) and infant mortality (infant deaths per 1000 live births). Black–White rate ratios were calculated for the birth outcomes to specifically examine the large Black–White disparity in birth outcomes. The analysis controlled for urbanicity, income inequality, median household income, residential segregation, and southern region, as well as a fixed effect for state level differences. Results: Findings show that counties with higher rates of incarceration have higher prevalence of infant mortality and low birthweight, as well as greater Black–White disparity in infant mortality. Mass incarceration is associated with increases in adverse birth outcomes and maternal vulnerability partially mediates this relationship. Conclusions: Findings provide evidence that heightened levels of incarceration affect birth outcomes for all residents at the county-level. It is imperative to address the overuse of mass incarceration in order to support adequate reproductive healthcare of vulnerable populations in the United States. © The Author(s) 2024.},

Drawing on a wider intersectional feminism, primary data from 72 people and thematic analysis, it seems both the reproductive and property rights of Balinese women are constrained. But ordinary Balinese women, activists, and intellectuals do not share the Western feminist case of dismantling communities for individual human rights. Instead, Balinese people largely advocate Hindu community alternatives, at the heart of which is strengthening the institution of ‘nyentana’. This alternative helps to decolonize “gender,” and reproductive justice, while putting the case for studying social economics a bit more in development studies. © 2024 The Author(s).},

This critical qualitative inquiry sheds light on Black women's perceived sense of safety in accessing pregnancy and intrapartum care. Twenty-four in-depth interviews were conducted with Black women who were pregnant or had given birth. Five interconnected themes were generated through thematic analysis: (1) There is a lot of prejudice towards us, (2) We are treated as sick bodies, (3) There is a lot of stereotypes towards us, (4) Our care is lacking in quality, and (5) We feel unsafe in the healthcare system. These themes highlight the perils faced by Black women accessing pregnancy and intrapartum care.

Despite such activism, access to SRH services has been fraught with persistent restrictions, particularly for abortion care. We sought the perspectives of key stakeholders on what makes for an effective SRH physician advocate and thoughts about the successes, failures, and needs of the abortion advocacy movement. We interviewed 15 SRH key informants (KIs) in sectors with expertise in organizational policy and advocacy (n = 6); clinical leadership and education (n = 3), media (n = 3), and reproductive justice (n = 3). The analytic team coded repeating ideas and conducted a thematic analysis, organizing findings within KI perspectives on the role of physician advocates in the field of abortion and contraception; successes, failures, and needs in abortion and contraception advocacy; and recommendations on the composition and components of an ideal clinician advocacy training program. KIs relayed that skill building related to communication, developing relationships with changemakers, and understanding political systems was critical for effective advocacy. They felt clinician advocacy training programs should include providers other than physicians and be designed for trainees to build relationships with one another over time. KI perspectives can be valuable in informing advocacy training programs and for contributing strategic approaches to increasing equitable and widespread access to SRH services. © 2022 Society for Public Health Education.},

	abstract = {Objective: To understand the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on abortion care-seeking in Maryland, a state with Medicaid coverage for abortion, high service availability, and laws supporting abortion rights. Methods: We conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with 15 women who had an abortion between January 2021 and March 2022 at a hospital-based clinic in a mid-sized Maryland city. We purposively recruited participants with varied pandemic financial impacts. Interview questions prompted participants to reflect on how the pandemic affected their lives, pregnancy decisions, and experiences seeking abortion care. We analyzed our data for themes. Results: All participants had some insurance coverage for their abortion; over half paid using Medicaid. Many participants experienced pandemic financial hardship, with several reporting job, food, and housing insecurity as circumstances influencing their decision to have an abortion. Most women who self-reported minimal financial hardship caused by the pandemic indicated they sought an abortion for reasons unrelated to COVID-19. In contrast, women with economic hardship viewed their pregnancies as unsupportable due to COVID-19 exacerbating financial instability, even when they desired to continue the pregnancy. All participants expressed that having an abortion was the best decision for their lives. Yet, when making decisions about their pregnancy, the most financially disadvantaged women weighed their desires against the pandemic's constraints on their reproductive self-determination. Conclusions: The pandemic changed abortion care-seeking circumstances even in a setting with minimal access barriers. Financial hardship influenced some women to have an abortion for a pregnancy that—while unplanned—they may have preferred to continue. © 2024 University of Ottawa.},

Yet, the whiteness of the pro-life movement is often hidden behind the discourses of colorblind racism through the U.S. cultural moment. To uncover and deconstruct this supposed “anti-racist” discourse, I study Evangelical women and their roles in the pro-life/anti-choice movement to explore their consequences on the narratives of abortion and reproductive health care from the 1970s to present. I conduct interviews and participant observation with self-described Evangelical pro-life women through ethnographic opportunities and events. In this study, I explore the intersectional issues of reproductive injustices through fieldwork and interviews with anti-choice women. These interviews and ethnographic data focus on a particular group of anti-choice organizers who prepare and oversee the logistics of this movement: pro-life women. How does it come to be that conservative women control the narratives of reproductive health care? How can ethnographic methods be utilized to unveil new information and knowledge surrounding the barriers to reproductive health care by the pro-life movement? I analyze this qualitative data to understand how the rhetoric of the pro-life/anti-choice movement invades the language of reproductive health in the United States and how a reproductive justice framework can begin to deconstruct this problematic flow. © 2023 SAGE Publications.},

	abstract = {Background: Pregnant people who use unregulated drugs (PPWUD) are at high risk of health complications yet experience a range of barriers to sexual and reproductive health care. Given that improving maternal health and access to reproductive health care are key targets underpinning the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), there is an urgent need to improve access to appropriate supports and services for this population. Little is known about what programs and practices exist to support PPWUD’s access to sexual and reproductive health care. This scoping review aimed to identify the available literature on these programs and practices in Canada. Methods: A scoping review was conducted using JBI methodology and reported using PRISMA guidelines. Scholarly databases and grey literature sources were searched to identify literature published between 2016–2023 in English or French that discussed, defined, conceptualised, or evaluated programs and practices that support PPWUD’s access to sexual and reproductive health care in Canada. Identified literature was screened using Covidence. Data were extracted from included texts, then analysed descriptively. Frequencies and key concepts were reported. Results: A total of 71 articles were included, most of which were grey literature. Of the total, 46 unique programs were identified, as well as several useful practices. Most programs were in urban centres in Western Canada, and most programs offered holistic ‘wrap-around services.’ Several programs delivered these services on-site or as ‘drop-in’ programs with the support of staff with lived/living experience of substance use. Most frequent program outcomes included keeping parents and children together, improving connection to other services, and reducing substance use harms. Noted helpful practices included non-judgmental care and the use of harm-reduction strategies. Conclusions: Several programs and practices that support PPWUD exist in Canada, though few focus exclusively on sexual and reproductive health. There remain opportunities to improve access to programs, including expanding geographic availability and range of services. The review has clinical application by providing an overview of available programs that may support clinicians in identifying services for PPWUD. Future research should consider client perspectives and experiences of these programs. Review registration number: Open Science Framework https://osf.io/5y64j . © 2024, The Author(s).},

Background: Supporting self-agency for women and birthing people in maternity care may be a way of addressing the disparities in vulnerability to violence and harm. Aim: To explore researchers’ perspectives of self-agency for women from different backgrounds, what inhibits and prevents self-agency, and how self-agency can be enabled. Methods: A qualitative research design was undertaken underpinned by a reproductive justice framework. Group interviews were held with researchers working with perinatal women/birthing people with histories and experiences of violence and abuse. Reflexive thematic analysis using Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory was undertaken. Findings: 12 participants took part in two group interviews. Two themes were developed: ‘defining self-agency’ and ‘ecological influences on self-agency’. Discussion: The findings identify how self-agency should not be perceived as an intrinsic attribute, but rather is underpinned by exogenous and endogenous influences. Whether and how self-agency is enacted is determined by interacting factors that operate on a micro, meso and macro level perspective. Self-agency is undermined by factors including immigration policies and sociocultural perspectives that can lead to under-resourced and judgemental care, other intersectional factors can also lead to some individuals being more vulnerable to violence and harm. Conclusion: Implications from this work include strategies that emphasise woman-centred care, staff training and meaningful organisational change to optimise positive health and wellbeing. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {In the current revival of fundamentalist right-wing politics globally, Poland occupies an important place given the struggles for abortion and reproductive justice that have been ongoing there since 2016. Together with Mexican, Argentinian, South Korean, and Italian women, Polish feminists contributed to creating the International Women’s Strike, which later spread throughout the globe, uniting movements in seventy countries. This article discusses the symmetric heroisms imposed by the conservative governments on women, who have to give birth “no matter what,” as well as on men, who are told to “defend their fatherland.” Such acute, gendered demands for heroism also perpetuate the binary heteromatrix, further marginalizing LGBTQIA+ people and groups. Recent Polish struggles have contributed to the shift in feminist proabortion narratives from the liberal one, centered on choice, to others more preoccupied with reproductive justice. This article argues that the recent legal limitations on access to abortion in Poland and other countries are central to the current effort to reestablish the rule of the state of exception. It also analyzes the weak resistance of grassroots feminist movements organizing for reproductive justice. The refusal to participate in heroic politics requires not only work for better access to abortion but also an alternative kind of subject formation, here tentatively defined as “unheroic,” as well as politics of weak resistance. © 2024 Ewa Majewska.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Discharge “against medical advice” (AMA) in the obstetric population is overall under-studied but disproportionally affects marginalized populations and is associated with worse perinatal outcomes. Reasons for discharges AMA are not well understood. The objective of this study is to identify the obstacles that prevent obstetric patients from accepting recommended care and highlight the structural reasons behind AMA discharges. Methods: Electronic health records of patients admitted to antepartum, peripartum, or postpartum services between 2008 and 2018 who left “AMA” were reviewed. Progress notes from clinicians and social workers were extracted and analyzed. Reasons behind discharge were categorized using qualitative thematic analysis. Results: Fifty-seven (0.12%) obstetric patients were discharged AMA. Reasons for discharge were organized into two overarching themes: extrinsic (50.9%) and intrinsic (40.4%) obstacles to accepting care. Eleven participants (19.3%) had no reason documented for their discharge. Extrinsic obstacles included childcare, familial responsibilities, and other obligations. Intrinsic obstacles included disagreement with provider regarding medical condition or plan, emotional distress, mistrust or discontent with care team, and substance use. Discussion: The term “AMA” casts blame on individual patients and fails to represent the systemic barriers to staying in care. Obstetric patients were found to encounter both extrinsic and intrinsic obstacles that led them to leave AMA. Healthcare providers and institutions can implement strategies that ameliorate structural barriers. Partnering with patients to prevent discharges AMA would improve maternal and infant health and progress towards reproductive justice. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {At a time when health-oriented institutions both globally and nationally are increasingly recognizing the need to support research, interventions and training that engage with analysis of how gendered social systems shape population health, independent of and in conjunction with sex-linked biology, it is essential that this work reject biological essentialism and instead embrace embodied integration. In this essay, guided by the ecosocial theory of disease distribution, I clarify connections and distinctions between biological versus social reproduction and inheritance, underscore the non-equivalence of the categories “sex” and “race,” and offer a set of examples analyzing the production of gendered health inequities and who needs to do what to address them. The examples concern the worlds of work (sexual harassment; breastfeeding; sex work), ecologic environments (water access; fracking, sexually transmitted infections, & sexual violence); sexual reproduction and reproductive justice (gender stereotyping of reproductive biology; sterilization abuse and abortion bans); and (4) gender transformative initiatives (violence; health interventions). To advance gender transformative intersectional science for health justice, I offer recommendations regarding requirements for justifying data conceptualization, analysis and governance that can be implemented by institutions with the power to shape the funding, translation, and publication of science involving gender, sex-linked biology, and the people's health. © 2023 The Author},

	abstract = {Prisons in the United States serve as a site and embodiment of gendered and racialized state violence. The US incarcerates more people than any other nation in both numbers and per capita rates. Individuals incarcerated in women’s prisons are 10% of the total prison population, yet women’s prisons remain understudied, and the violence that occurs in women’s facilities is rampant, widespread, and operates in particular racialized and gendered ways. This paper centers the forced sterilizations that occurred in California state prisons over the last two decades. We consider how reproduction and the nuclear family have served as a primary site of racial capitalism and eugenic ideology. While eugenic policies were popularized and promoted across the US and globally in the 20th century, the violent ideas underlying eugenic ideology have been a constant presence throughout US history. The height of the eugenics era is marked by the forcible sterilization of institutionalized ‘deviant’ bodies. While discussions of eugenics often center these programs, the reach of eugenic policies extends far beyond surgical interventions. We utilize a reproductive justice lens to argue that the hierarchical, racialized social stratification necessary for the existence of prisons constructs and sustains the ‘deviant’ bodies and families that predicate eugenic logic, policies, and practices. In this conceptual paper, we draw from ongoing research to argue that prisons, as institutions and as a product of racial capitalism, perpetuate the ongoing violent legacy of eugenics and name abolition as a central component of the fight to end reproductive oppression. © 2024 by the authors.},

Introduction: Reproductive justice is defined as the right to maintain personal bodily autonomy, to have or not have children, and to parent children in safe and sustainable communities. The reproductive justice framework is often applied to adult women in conventional care settings; however, the need for health care guided by the framework should extend to all females of reproductive age in all care settings, including pediatric settings. Inclusion criteria: This review will consider studies from 1994 to the present that report on the barriers and facilitators of reproductive justice in pediatric health care. Studies from any setting or geographic location will be included. This scoping review will include pediatric patients up to 21 years of age of any gender identity or sexual orientation who may birth a child, and their health care providers. Methods: Database searches will include CINAHL (EBSCOhost), MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Elsevier), and Web of Science Core Collection. Sources of unpublished studies and gray literature to be searched include MedNar and ProQuest Dissertation and Theses Science and Engineering Collection (ProQuest). The JBI methodology for scoping reviews will be followed. Data extracted will include details about the title, authors, year of publication, type of evidence, participants, context, and concept. The extracted data will be presented in diagrammatic or tabular format in a manner that aligns with the objective and questions of the scoping review.  © 2023 JBI.},

	abstract = {Objectives: This study aimed to explore the perceptions of Roma women about their experience of menarche and reproductive health considering the principles of reproductive justice. Design: Qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews with Roma women ages 18 through 67 in different neighborhoods in the southeast of Spain. Using a thematic analysis, we analyzed experiences related to menarche and menstruation and their significance for reproductive health, the preparation for the phase of menarche and intergenerational support. Results: The Roma women interviewed shared their approach to the experiences of menarche and menstruation as children in their family environments with a focus on access to information provided by other women in the family and community for reproductive health management. In their discourses we observed that the onset of menstruation supposes a rupture in the public and private spaces of girls and women. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that women and girls do not gain access to information that contributes to their reproductive wellbeing through their experience of menarche. Access to resources and skills to manage biological changes in adolescents could contribute to reducing the impact of cultural myths, false ideas and taboos that prevent advocacy and empowerment on issues of reproductive justice. © The Author(s) 2023.},

We argue for careful baseline qualitative research infused with feminist and reproductive justice theory and, based on the findings of this research, the development and refinement of healthcare provider training through action research. We report on our implementation of this process in developing an in-service person-centered abortion counseling training course aimed at South African abortion healthcare providers. The baseline research consisted of recordings of abortion counseling sessions and interviews with healthcare providers and users. Several problematic directive and anti-abortion interactions were surfaced, which led to the development of a policy brief and step-by-step guidelines for providers. Subsequently, action research was employed to operationalize these guidelines into an in-service person-centered abortion counseling training course, and an iterative process enabled course improvement. Data collected for the course refinement included recordings of various sessions during the course, participants reflective journals, case presentations, and feedback forms, as well as interviews conducted two months post the first course. Comparing baseline findings with data collected as part of the action research shows some shifts in healthcare providers actions. We report on a shift in respecting bodily autonomy and encouraging autonomous decision-making. Structural and normative barriers continue, however. The enactment of reproductive justice through in-service training shows promise but must be supplemented with advocacy around other barriers. © 2024 American Psychological Association Inc..

	abstract = {Permanent contraception is the most used method of contraception among women aged 15-49 years and is one of the most straightforward surgical procedures an obstetrician-gynecologist can perform. At the same time, this therapeutic option is enormously complex when considered from a historical, sociological, or ethical perspective. This Committee Statement reviews ethical issues related to permanent contraception using a reproductive justice framework. Ethical counseling and shared decision making for permanent contraception should adopt a nonjudgmental, patient-centered approach, using up-to-date information about permanent contraception procedures and alternatives. Obstetrician-gynecologists should strive to avoid bringing into the clinical encounter biases around gender, race, age, and class that affect thoughts on who should or should not become a parent. Obstetrician-gynecologists should also ensure that permanent contraception requests reflect each patient's wishes, come from a desire to permanently end childbearing, and come from a preference for permanent contraception over all reversible methods as well as permanent contraception for the male partner. When difficulties in meeting a postpartum permanent contraception request are anticipated and permanent contraception is desired by the patient, transfer of care for the remainder of pregnancy should be offered. ACOG recognizes the right of all patients to unimpeded access to permanent contraception as a way of ensuring health equity, but it is unclear how to craft policies that protect from coercion but also do not create barriers to autonomously desired care. Determining the ethical balance between access and safeguards will require a collaborative interdisciplinary approach that involves a variety of stakeholders with varying perspectives. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

	abstract = {Background: Many pregnant individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) spend time in jail, yet access to standard of care medications for OUD (MOUD) in jail is limited. Though qualitative studies of non-incarcerated pregnant and non-pregnant incarcerated individuals with OUD demonstrate complexities that must be considered in delivering effective care, studies with pregnant, incarcerated patients with OUD are lacking. Methods: We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews from October 2020–November 2021 with pregnant and postpartum people with OUD who were currently or previously in jail in Florida, Maryland, Ohio, and Virginia. Interview guides incorporated understandings of the power dynamics of incarceration and gendered expectations of motherhood. We analyzed transcripts using descriptive phenomenology to identify themes around experiences of treatment or withdrawal in jail and upon release. Results: We interviewed 32 women, 23 pregnant and nine postpartum. Some received MOUD in jail and others endured withdrawal. All participants expressed concern for their babies. Five themes emerged: 1)lack of counseling or accurate information about MOUD in pregnancy; 2)absent, delayed, or coercive care in jail; 3)experiences of stigma and discrimination from staff and caregivers; 4)structural barriers to safe transitions and continuing MOUD; and 5)the destructive presence of child protective services for care continuity. These factors all influenced their ability to recover. Conclusions: Jails must provide OUD care that is attentive to pregnancy physiology, pregnancy-stigma, reentry needs, and patients’ fetal-newborn concerns. Tailoring care specific to pregnancy and postpartum context can improve recovery success, reduce overdose, and promote intergenerational equity. © 2024 The Authors},

These methods can and should be integrated into socio-legal studies because they provide us with a way to capture the legal elements of interlocking power structures, offer ways to meaningfully compare and predict what access to rights will look like across jurisdictions, and capture a new way to study legal pluralism across and within jurisdictions. To illustrate the benefit of such methods for studying legal pluralism, this article offers the State Reproductive Autonomy Index, which compares all fifty states on seventy-five variables. Modeled on legal epidemiology's survey of multiple types of law, including laws that can be classified as infrastructural (laying the institutional or policy parameters), interventionist (specifically targeted to produce a result), and incidental (distally related, not intentionally), this method integrates the work of reproductive justice scholars with the work on legal pluralism to illustrate the vast inequalities in access to reproductive autonomy across the United States. The State Reproductive Autonomy Index also shows why reproductive justice, rather than reproductive rights discourse, is a more accurate frame for understanding laws relating to reproduction and bodily autonomy. © The Author(s), 2022.

	abstract = {Assisted reproductive technology (ART), which encompasses fertility treatments in which eggs or embryos are handled, is a frontier of family law and reproductive justice, and developments in abortion jurisprudence may shape its borders. Abortion restrictions and other laws regulating pregnant people are often framed with rhetoric emphasizing fetal personhood or fetal rights. Now that abortion is legally unshielded from criminalization, the consequences of Dobbs will reach, as did fetal-personhood laws before, even those who are not seeking abortions. As commentators have observed, this collateral damage threatens to touch potential parents seeking to use ART. Yet so far, the most abortion-restrictive states tend to carve out protections for ART from their laws regarding fetuses. This Note argues that states touting fetal personhood protect ART users—while persecuting people who partake in a multitude of other types of conduct thought to harm fetuses—because ART furthers the creation of white, affluent families that suit these states’ normative values. Fetal personhood, then, is a tool for social control. Advocates of reproductive freedom should surface this truth in efforts to stave off the proliferation of fetal-personhood laws at the state and federal levels. © 2024, New York University School of Law.

	abstract = {In the quest to create global maternal health care protocols, African Indigenous birthing epistemologies are often overlooked in research, policy, and advocacy aiming to improve maternal health and reduce the maternal mortality ratio (MMR). The global maternal health strategy, the Safe Motherhood Initiative (SMI), excludes Indigenous birthing knowledge by requiring all childbirth to be attended by only birth attendants trained in the Western medical paradigm. This forms the bedrock of the assumed authoritative expertise of the Western medical birthing approach. Despite the campaign for sole reliance on SMI, Africa's MMR remains the highest compared to other regions. Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, also has the third-highest MMR in the world as of 2020. This failure of SMI to reduce MMR for Nigeria and Africa more broadly calls for the inclusion of marginalized Indigenous birthing knowledge for its epistemological and practical significance. Using Nigeria as a case study, with a transnational connection with the United States, the article argues that excluding African birthing knowledge and methods in SMI promotes epistemic and obstetric violence. Adopting the reproductive justice framework as a decolonial tool, the article asserts that African Indigenous birthing knowledge is simultaneously valid and valuable for holistic approaches to maternal health. © 2024 Duke University Press.

	abstract = {Epidemiological studies conducted in high-income countries have shown that immigrant mothers and their children suffer from an augmented morbidity and mortality, including with regard to their mental health. Drawing on the “niche sociality” concept (Manning et al., 2023) as an analytic tool, our paper aims to analyze the postpartum experience of immigrant mothers in Switzerland as well as the circumstances to which these mothers connect their experience and often their distress. This qualitative study included semidirected interviews with immigrant mothers (n=20) and with the health and social care professionals who cared for them (n=26) as well as ethnographic observations. We conducted a thematic analysis and triangulated the data produced with mothers themselves and professionals. Immigrant mothers shared mixed feelings regarding their experience. They often lived their maternity while experiencing a gendered loneliness. As members of transnational families, they dearly missed their relatives living abroad. Their position as new mothers and as immigrant persons comprised complex sociomaterial ordeals related to their (un)employment, housing, and sociality. Drawing from their practice in the community, professionals' narratives completed mothers'. Professionals critiqued the unequal access to quality health care as well as the petty measures that interfered with mothers' and infants’ safety that were taken by street-level bureaucrats (Lipsky, 2010 (1980)). Reflexive and engaging, mothers shared sensible and nuanced narratives about their experience and initiatives to rebuild their niche sociality. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {In recent years, health-data-driven artificial intelligence and machine learning applications have been introduced to many areas of medicine. In the field of assisted reproduction, artificial intelligence and machine learning applications and related technologies have been hailed as (potentially) significant and ground-breaking, not least because they promise standardisation and automation in in-vitro fertilisation clinics – a precondition for scaling up and branching out in the fertility bioindustry. Artificial intelligence data-driven algorithms promise time- and cost-effective selection of ‘high-quality’ reproductive cells and successful personalised treatments. In this essay, we aim to critically discuss artificial intelligence as a technological clinical practice, which is currently moving from bench to bedside internationally. Through an analytic framework of reproductive justice, we propose that introducing artificial intelligence into this already stratified context threatens to black-box health disparities and to generate what we refer to as ‘hyper-stratifications’ of reproduction in the context of rising health and social disparities in the European context. As feminist, social science and bioethics scholars, we are all too aware of how reproductive technologies reinforce normativities rather than unravel them. We cannot presume that artificial intelligence is an ethical technological agent or user of health data but, instead, need to keep a critical eye on the moral ambivalence of emerging and evolving artificial intelligence-assisted reproduction technologies practices and their gendered consequences. Given the current hype around artificial intelligence, but also with concerns around the fast development and deployment of artificial intelligence generally and in artificial intelligence-assisted reproduction technologies particularly in mind, there is an urgent need to engage in critical feminist discussion of such developments. © The Author(s) 2024.},

The analysis reveals that war affects women's sexual and reproductive health in three ways, through violent politicisation, collateral damage, and intersectional dimensions. First, multiple armed actors have used women's health as an instrument in politically motivated strategies to increase their power, assigning political meaning to sexuality and reproduction within the context of war. Second, women's health has also suffered from secondary damage of conflict resulting from a decay in healthcare service provision and an unmet need for healthcare services among those affected by sexual and reproductive violence. Third, marginalised women have been particularly affected by a discriminatory nexus of poverty, ethnicity, and geographic inequality.

	abstract = {Jasmine is an 18-year-old Black female bringing her infant to the pediatrician for a newborn weight check. She asks her pediatrician's opinion about hormonal contraceptive injections, sharing that they were strongly recommended after she gave birth. The recommending health care provider told her, "We don't want you to end up back here any time soon."Rosita, a 16-year-old Latina female, visits her pediatrician for a well check. She reports a history of vaginal sex with 2 male partners and agrees to have a hormonal subcutaneous implant placed to avoid pregnancy. After 4 months of bothersome spotting, Rosita returns to have the implant removed. Rosita's provider strongly counsels against removal. Jasmine and Rosita are members of populations that have been systematically marginalized throughout American history. Their stories are derived from real cases and reveal how structural racism impacts modern contraceptive care. Specifically, their cases are examples of statistical discrimination, wherein the tendency to disproportionately recommend long-acting reversible contraception to historically marginalized communities does not follow the central tenants of sexual and reproductive justice, including acknowledging historical harms in health care and honoring bodily autonomy for all people. By sharing Jasmine and Rosita's stories, we use a reproductive justice lens to (1) examine the historical roots of disproportional prescription of long-acting reversible contraception to historically marginalized individuals, (2) discuss provider bias related to sexual and reproductive health care, and (3) illustrate how trauma-informed care with a recognition of historical trauma and the use of individuation can facilitate positive and equitable health outcomes.  © 2024 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.},

	abstract = {This study explores how Swedish women narrate experiences of hormonal contraceptives through utilizing the frameworks of biomedicalization and reproductive justice, adding a social justice perspective previously lacking. Ten in-depth interviews were conducted with women who had experience of using hormonal contraception. Political narrative analysis illuminated how these women moved narratively both chronologically, from the teenage years to adulthood, and through social positioning, in their contraceptive stories. Two different, often conflicting, discourses of hormonal contraceptives emerged, which the women constantly negotiated. These can be described as (1) a biomedical interpretative prerogative, promoting hormonal methods as an easy fit for everyone, and negating the diverse lived experiences of women, and (2) a simplified critical media and online discourse, painting hormonal methods as an enemy to female health. From a reproductive justice standpoint, these stories illuminate that age is a relevant intersectional location, and even privileged women in a country known for its ‘gender equality agenda’ can experience subtle yet very real, reproductive coercion, when agency becomes constrained to choosing hormonal contraceptives within a dominant biomedical script. Even though critique of the mechanistic prescription of hormonal contraception is rather ubiquitous, the opposition in these narratives does not take the form of rejection of biomedical knowledge, rather the biomedical paradigm is internalized and incorporated into the embodied knowledge. This study shows that upstream factors such as gendered social injustices, reproductive norms, and a biomedical expansion are intricately interwoven with embodied experience of hormonal contraceptive use. It is important to acknowledge that distinct lived experiences of mood or personality change in women using hormonal contraceptives are contextual and dependent on intersectional location. I propose no simple panacea, but when a state-sanctioned biomedical prerogative puts all emphasis on individual reproductive planning behaviour, it obscures structural inequalities and narrows imaginable life trajectories. © The Author(s) 2024.},

Medoro focuses on discourses of life and women’s (non)reproductive sexuality in Edgar Allan Poe and Nathaniel Hawthorne's fiction. She establishes that the two authors were deeply skeptical of medicolegal definitions of life that created racial and economic hierarchies; through focal characters and indirect, playful prose, they critique discourses of life that valued some lives over others in the creation of Anglo-American nationalism. Tavera investigates late-nineteenth-century woman-authored medical fiction as directly engaging many of the same concepts Medoro explores- (P)rescription Narratives calls attention to the ways that Comstock-era censorship colluded with race science, medicine, and die law to limit women's sexual and reproductive autonomy. It demonstrates literature’s agential capacities as the writers it addresses explicitly refute and redirect objectifying narratives. Combined, these texts show that questions of what “counts’ as life, and by what (and whose) paradigms those lives can be lived, are hardly theoretical musings. Rather, thev determine, systemically and corporeally, “life's legibility and reproduction... in the name of American citizenship’ (Medoro 19). These texts, in other words, are highly relevant and important as literary and cultural scholarship, making a powerful argument for the study of the humanities. But they are also important because they document the subversive and agential power of the written word to discern, document, and possibly heal—to affect change for today and the future. © CANADIAN REVIEW OF AMERICAN STUDIES 2024.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Abortion is a health practice that people might choose for a variety of reasons. In public discourse, a subtle hierarchy of legitimacy frequently emerges in relation to abortion’ motivations, thereby establishing an implicit distinction between abortions deemed acceptable or justifiable and those considered unacceptable or unjustifiable. Methods: We conducted an experimental study to examine the impact of different motivations commonly perceived as “good and acceptable” (i.e., health risks or rape) and “bad and unacceptable” (i.e., lack of desire to have a child or incompatibility between women’s lives and their careers) on the stigmatization of women who choose to abort (i.e., moral outrage and attribution of humanness) and the perceived severity of hostile behaviors against them. Results: Findings show that participants experienced more moral outrage towards the woman when she chose to abort for “bad and unacceptable” reasons (vs. “good and acceptable”), attributed her less humanness, and perceived hostile behaviors toward her as less severe. In addition, we found that “bad and unacceptable” reasons influenced participants’ perceptions of hostile behaviors through the mediation of moral outrage and the attribution of humanness to her. Conclusions and Policy Implications: Highlighting motivations for abortion reinforces not only the divide between “good” and “bad” abortions but also between “good” and “bad” women. The key conclusions, limitations, and directions for the future are explored in the context of combating abortion stigma and backlash, ultimately advocating for reproductive justice. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

Introduction: Contraceptive counseling is the transfer of knowledge regarding contraceptive methods to aid an individual in selecting, discontinuing, or changing contraception. The counselor should deliver information based on the patient's needs and preferences. The type and quality of the contraceptive information women are provided should not vary based on social or physical factors, such as age, race, religion, sexual orientation, education level, sexual preference, or weight; however, professional bias continues to be a concern in health care. The results of this review may further the understanding of counselor bias and contraceptive counseling. Inclusion criteria: This scoping review will consider studies that include health care professionals providing contraceptive counseling to female patients in any setting or geographic location. Studies reporting on factors, tools, and interventions related to counselor bias and contraceptive counseling will be included. Methods: Databases to be searched are MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, JBI Evidence-based Practice Database, Europe PubMed Central, and Cochrane Library. Sources of gray literature will include ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, PaperFirst, and MedNar. The review will include studies published in English from 1994 onward and follow the JBI methodology for scoping reviews. Two independent reviewers will screen the titles and abstracts, then full texts. Data from relevant studies will be extracted using a tool created by the reviewers. The results will be presented as a narrative summary and in diagrammatic or tabular format. Review registration: Open Science Framework https://osf.io/judp5. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

To successfully fight attacks on bodily autonomy, social workers would benefit from applying an intersectional and rights-based, reproductive justice theoretical framework that blends under-explored theories of state violence: biopolitics, necropolitics, and debility. Our resulting framework elucidates the role white supremacy plays in state violence. After providing the theoretical framework, we connect the framework to the modern political landscape's rapidly spreading efforts to limit the sovereignty of People of Color, women, and transgender and non-binary communities in the latest iterations of state violence. Our article provides a necessary lens to understand and address the complex web of implications that emerge from attacks on bodily autonomy. © The Author(s) 2024.},

In Reproductive Justice, Adoption, and Foster Care, the authors situate the colonial legacies of family separation, what it means to center the right parent, and Reproductive Justice and transnational feminist frameworks in conversation with one another in order to elucidate a more nuanced and comprehensive approach to recognizing the significance of contemporary examples of family separation. In doing so, the book showcases the connections between adoption and foster care within the intellectual and activist frameworks of human rights, Critical Adoption Studies, Reproductive Justice, and transnational feminisms. Epistemologically, Reproductive Justice and transnational feminisms meet at the point where both consider and interrogate globalizing capitalism, neoliberal economic and political ideologies, and the ways that various people—mostly people of color, poor people, women, children, and Indigenous people—are considered disposable. Critical Adoption Studies also importantly highlights the ways that adoption and foster care function as forms of family formation and as mechanisms of globalizing capitalism and state formation. Thus, it is critical that any exploration of the reproductive experiences of marginalized individuals interrogate and complicate notions of “choice” to advocate for justice. Reproductive Justice, Adoption, and Foster Care will be of interest to students of sociology, psychology, and social work, as well as scholars, activists, policymakers, and adoption and foster care practitioners. © 2024 Tanya Saroj Bakhru and Krista L.

	abstract = {This article examines the interplay of queer reproduction and private assisted reproductive technologies (ART) companies in urban China. While same-sex marriage has not gained legal recognition in mainland China and childbirth outside heterosexual marriage has been restricted, queer parents who have children through ART have gradually become visible. ART has emerged as an ideal way for Chinese queer citizens to have children, though they are not legally permitted to use ART services in domestic hospitals. Consequently, an increasing number of queer intended parents turned to underground ART businesses, with some of them becoming salespeople or business owners themselves. My ethnographic analysis comes from fieldworks conducted in Guangdong province, China, from 2018 to 2021. This paper shows that the legal and moral debates brought by queer people’s use of ART are perceived differently among diverse gender and sexual groups in Chinese society. It founds that queer parents’ participation in the ART industry has demonstrated the potential for queer forms of parenthood and family, while reinforcing stratified reproduction and gender inequalities. The tendency to reduce IVF/surrogacy to “womb-for-rent” business among Chinese ART businesses continues to impact queer people’s reproductive and parenting rights. This paper hopes to offer insights into queer reproductive justice and reproductive technologies across the globe. © 2024 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {This study examined lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex (LGBTQI) cancer patients’ sexual well-being post-cancer, and the associations between sexual well-being and social support, physical concerns, distress, quality of life (QOL), and coping. We used a mixed-methods approach, including 430 surveys and 103 interviews, representing a range of tumor types, sexual and gender identities, age groups, and intersex status. The findings indicated that LGBTQI people with cancer experience declines in sexual well-being following cancer, which are associated with reduced QOL, greater physical concerns, and lower social support. The perceived helpfulness of coping mechanisms was associated with greater sexual well-being across genders, with cisgender men reporting the sharpest declines in sexual well-being and highest use of coping mechanisms. Across all groups, searching for information online was the most frequently used coping mechanism, with support groups and counseling the most under-utilized. Qualitative findings facilitated interpretation of these results, providing examples of ways in which cancer impacted sexual well-being and how physical changes influence sexual embodiment or desire to engage in sex. Concerns about reduced sexual desire and activity, associated with changes to breasts, vulva, vagina, penis, erectile dysfunction, incontinence, scarring, and stoma, reflect previous findings in the non-LGBTQI cancer population. Unique to this population are the impact of physical changes on LGBTQI embodiment, including disruption to sexual and gender identities, and feelings of disconnection from queer communities. Addressing LGBTQI sexual well-being within oncology healthcare is a matter of sexual and reproductive justice, for a population whose needs are often overlooked within cancer care. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Racism pervades the US criminal legal and family policing systems, particularly impacting cases involving women with a history of a substance use disorder (SUD). Laws criminalizing SUD during pregnancy disproportionately harm Black women, as do family policing policies around family separation. Discrimination within intersecting systems may deter Black pregnant women with a SUD from seeking evidence-based pregnancy and substance use care. This convergent parallel mixed-methods study aimed to illuminate how systemic oppression influenced the lived experiences of Black mothers with a SUD, facing dual involvement in the criminal legal and family policing systems. Using convenience and snowball sampling techniques, we recruited 15 Black mothers who were incarcerated, used substances while pregnant, and had a history with family policing systems. We conducted semi-structured interviews and developed and distributed a scale questionnaire to describe participants’ experiences navigating overlapping systems of surveillance and control. Drawing on models of systemic anti-Black racism and sexism and reproductive justice, we assessed participants’ experiences of racism and gender-based violence within these oppressive systems. Participants described how intersecting systems of surveillance and control impeded their prenatal care, recovery, and abilities to parent their children in gender and racially specific ways. Although they mostly detailed experiences of interpersonal discriminatory treatment, particularly from custody staff while incarcerated and pregnant, participants highlighted instances of systemic anti-Black gendered racism and obstetric racism while accessing prenatal care and substance use treatment in carceral and community settings. Their narratives emphasize the need for action to measure and address the upstream macro-level systems perpetuating inequities. © W. Montague Cobb-NMA Health Institute 2024.},

	abstract = {This Article interrogates the current and future role of employer-sponsored health insurance in reproductive autonomy, revealing the impact that employers’ coverage choices have on access to reproductive care and the legal infrastructure that prioritizes employer choice over individual autonomy. Over half of the population depends on employers for health insurance. Laws regulating employer plans give employers exceptionally wide latitude to decide what reproductive care services, if any, to cover. In their role as health care funders, employers pursue interests that often conflict with employees’ interests and the aims of reproductive justice. Employers balk at covering services related to conceiving and bearing children, which they view as costly to them as both employers and insurers. While some employers’ plans cover contraception and abortion, which may help them avoid the costs of pregnancy and additional dependents, many other employers object to covering these services. The legal infrastructure validates this wide spectrum of employers’ choices, subordinating individuals’ autonomy to their employers’ interests. Decoupling health care access from employment is thus necessary to bolster reproductive justice. But the most effective means of decoupling— a public option and single-payer public benefits—raise tough questions about reproductive exceptionalism. Shifting the third-party payment role from employers to governments does not truly remove the threat to reproductive justice, so progressive health reform risks sacrificing reproductive justice to the cause of universal benefits. This Article illuminates how vigilantly centering reproductive justice in single-payer reform proposals can make those reforms more feasible and durable. © 2024, Columbia Law Review Association.

	abstract = {Introduction: Healthcare services for pregnant and postpartum (‘perinatal’) women were reconfigured significantly at the advent and for the duration of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and despite the United Kingdom announcing ‘Freedom Day’ on 19 July 2021 (whereafter all legal lockdown-related restrictions were lifted), restrictions to maternity (antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal) services remained. This study presents data from eight perinatal women about their experiences of psychosocial wellbeing and maternity care in the post-‘Freedom Day’ epoch. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted virtually, with data recorded, transcribed, and analysed by hand. Grounded theory analysis was employed with the final theory assessing the reproductive injustice of the pandemic ‘Freedom Day’. Results: Analysing iteratively and inductively led to four emergent themes: ‘A Failing System, Failing Women’; ‘Harm Caused by a State of Difference’; ‘The Privileges (Not Rights) of Reproductive Autonomy, Agency, and Advocacy’; and ‘Worried Women and Marginalised Mothers’. Together, these themes form the theory of ‘Freedom for some, but not for Mum’. Discussion: Women experienced a lack of high-quality reliable information about the pandemic, vaccination against the virus, and the changes to, and decision-making surrounding, their perinatal care. Women recognised healthcare professionals and maternity services were stretched and that maternity services were failing but often reported hostility from staff and abandonment at times when they were unsure about how to navigate their care. The most singular injustice was the disparity between women having to accept continuing restrictions to their freedom whilst receiving maternity care and the (reckless) freedom being enacted by the general public.

Marginalized communities, including disabled people, also faced growing threats to their reproductive freedom throughout the pandemic. The United States has a lengthy history of weaponizing reproduction to subjugate people with disabilities, and these injustices increased during the pandemic. Informed by the reproductive justice framework, this chapter analyzes reproductive inequities experienced by disabled people before and during the pandemic, focusing on examining how law and policy affect these disparities. It proposes normative legal and policy solutions to address deeply entrenched inequities affecting disabled people’s reproductive freedom during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

Regarding reproductive justice, BLM, as well as organizations like the Black Mamas Matter Alliance and Sistersong, have drawn political attention to the oppressive parameters existing for pregnant people birthing while Black. Attention to disparities in health and birth outcomes for Black persons has necessary positive effects, such as the ability to produce data on the deleterious effects of anti-Blackness. However, discourses surrounding Black birthing persons can function to obfuscate the collective action undertaken by Black women and non-Black women of color. In this paper, I argue the hyper-focus on the problems Black pregnant/birthing persons face has at least four issues: (1) it encourages an ontological collapse wherein Black birthers are positioned as problems, rather than human beings facing problems; (2) obscures the collective action and care Black women undertake to support one another; (3) results in state solutions that rely on underpaid and volunteer labor of Black and non-Black women of color; and (4) focuses myopically on the time period of pregnancy and birthing for Black persons.  © The Author(s), 2024.

While recognizing the importance of ensuring safe, legal, and affordable abortion access, RJ extends beyond this narrow focus and delves into the complex intersections of race, gender, sexuality, and social class. Employing principles from Black feminist praxis in utilizing Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) methods, we conducted qualitative interviews to center the voices and experiences of 24 self-identified Black women. The research uncovers three main themes: 1) Ideological violence against Black women, with subthemes: beauty and body image, strength and resilience, and stigmatized mothering; 2) Distrust in daycare services; and 3) Hurdles for low income women in accessing abortion care. These findings shed light on a post-Roe reproductive justice landscape for Black women in Cincinnati. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

It is one of the most challenging aspects of contemporary midwifery practice in high-income countries, although rarely discussed and reflected on during pre- and post-registration midwifery training. Ethnic and racial disparities are prevalent both in child protection and maternity services and can be explained through an intersectional lens, accounting for biases based on race, gender, class, and societal beliefs around motherhood. With this paper, we aim to contribute to the growing body of critical midwifery studies and re-think the role of midwives in this context. Building on principles of reproductive justice theory, Intersectionality, and Standpoint Midwifery, we argue that midwives play a unique role when supporting women who go through child protection processes and should pursue a shift from passive bystander to active upstander to improve care for this group of mothers. © 2024 The Authors.

Morgentaler, which deemed the existing federal abortion law unconstitutional, Canada has operated without criminal restrictions on abortion. Despite the distinctive nature of Canada's approach, there is a dearth of scholarly work that has explicitly traced the process through which abortion decriminalization materialized and offered an in-depth examination of its effectiveness. This paper aims to address this gap in two ways. First, it traces the process through which abortion decriminalization emerged in Canada, which resulted from a combination of context-specific circumstances and sociopolitical factors. Second, it argues that while Canada's pathway to abortion decriminalization is distinct and may not be directly transferable to other contexts, there are nonetheless insights to be drawn from the Canadian experience. The promise of abortion decriminalization, as both a governance and advocacy framework, lies in its efficacy, its ability to navigate constraints of the law, and its strategic and symbolic advantages. © The Author(s) 2024.},

However, practitioners may be hesitant to follow these new guidelines if they do not understand how maternal morbidity and mortality are rooted in fundamental causes like racism. If practitioners believe that pregnancy is innately dangerous, they may prioritize effectiveness in the name of patient safety. Taking a reproductive justice perspective, we assess how contraceptive counseling guidance portrays maternal morbidity/mortality by qualitatively examining 25 authoritative gynecology publications. Our abductive analysis shows that these documents describe maternal morbidity/mortality as rooted in biology and position highly effective contraception as the antidote. Ignoring fundamental causes of maternal morbidity/mortality impedes progress toward patient-centered contraceptive counseling and shifts the burden of addressing maternal morbidity/mortality away from public policy and toward individual contraceptive use. © 2024 Society for Menstrual Cycle Research.},

	abstract = {This paper provides a revised history of an understudied event in the trajectory of Indian political modernity - the moment of the legalization of abortion in 1971. The existing scholarship on the event reads it as one that was motivated purely by a developmentalist vision of a modernizing postcolonial elite, to the extent that the latter regarded increases in human numbers as hindrance to economic growth and identified abortion-legalization as a key solution to this quandary. While merited, such interpretations do not account for the varied techniques of persuasion mobilized by the parliamentarians/ lawmakers responsible for debating the laws. With the help of extensive archival analysis of the parliamentary debates, the paper shows how the modes of reasoning put forth in these debates were not always pegged to a developmentalist paradigm but rather made unequivocal use of a heterogeneous idiom of “compassion” for the woman, victimized by male irresponsibility, to ground its case. The lawmakers’ mobilization of this concept further recognized that the victimized pregnant woman’s standpoint is epistemically inaccessible/ incommensurable to those who are responsible for adjudicating on the act of abortion. An acknowledgement of this incommensurability between the knowledge that the two parties hold, became the foundation for compassion. In the process of elucidating the use of the idiom of compassion broached in these parliamentary debates, the paper broadens our interpretations of global histories of welfare feminism in general and reproductive justice in particular. © 2024 The Author(s).

Significant in its radical criminalization of abortion, Dobbs reinvigorated feminist activism for reproductive justice. Digital and mobile technologies are used in innovative ways by activists to organize, educate, and dispel counter-narratives about abortion, including feminist global networks that provide medication abortion and abortion storytelling through social media and media interventions. There continue to be analogue interventions that are the legacy of the 1960’s-era Jane Collective. In this vexatious legal environment, the communication technologies that facilitate abortion activism are weaponized by restrictionist actors to not only misinform, but also, through abortion surveillance, to track and curtail access to reproductive care by tapping into and exploiting what we term the personal data economy of reproductive health. Activists are thus countering the surveillant assemblages engaged by restrictionist states whose objective is to criminalize abortion access and care across borders. This article considers the historical and current media ecology surrounding reproductive health, care and justice, the technologies that have and continue to shape it, and the array of analogue, digital, mobile and hybrid feminist activist interventions emerging post-Roe. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Casey in June 2022 solidified the patchwork nature of abortion access in the United States and clarified, for some, the need to move beyond a framework of reproductive rights toward an approach to reproductive justice that would guarantee medical autonomy for individuals in the pursuit of (not) becoming parents. We present the dissent in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization as an attempt to create a legally intelligible reproductive justice. We analyze the excesses of the dissent—the violations of generic and institutional norms concerning, specifically, the inclusion of the lived experiences of pregnant people. We conclude, however, that the capacity for rhetorical invention in the dissent is muted by the uncritical (re)circulation of neoliberal tropes endemic to the Supreme Court and the broader abortion debate in the United States.

These frameworks have tended toward an agent-centered view of moral obligations in disasters which map disasters against the mythology of the state of nature and its associated justifications for the exercise of state power. In their focus on individual desert and the restoration of rights and property, established moral frameworks have failed to attend to the inequitable impacts of disaster, particularly in the disparate and disproportionate ways that they impact women and communities of color. In this chapter, we draw on feminist philosophy and Black feminist organizing praxis in order to offer alternate frameworks for theorizing disasters and the duties of response. We develop an account of disaster rooted in the ethics of care, highlighting the ways that disasters are primarily crises of care. These crises of care are organized through privatized local and global care chains which distribute care toward the privileged, producing care drains that exacerbate the inequitable impact of disaster in ways that are rarely captured in established ethical frameworks for disaster. In search of alternate ethical frameworks, we explore resources within Black feminist organizing in order to develop an account of resistant care ethics, capable of reshaping priorities in disaster management and response. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {Access to sexual health, sexuality information, sexual expression and sexual pleasure is a human right. Yet, the sexual health and wellness landscape has become a battlefield. Recently large-scale sex-negative campaigns preceded the US Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022. The use of the word ‘gay’ was restricted in public schools along with efforts to ban drag queen story time. Further reports of increased violence against people who identify as transgender have increased. Given social work’s roots as an anti-oppressive, practice-based profession focused on social justice, social workers are ideally positioned to challenge this attack on sexual rights, sexual pleasure, and access to related services. Sexual justice pedagogy is a warranted first step. A review of the literature establishes the rationale behind sexuality being a human right, examining social work’s missed opportunities for sexual justice. Next, the current sexuality assault landscape in the US is reviewed and sexual justice is defined within social justice. Activities are presented providing educators exemplars to introduce sexual justice content in human rights teaching. I conclude with recommendations to create a learning environment that will help facilitate the understanding and integration of sexual justice within the teaching of human rights to social work students. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Racial and socioeconomic disparities in maternal health outcomes are significant in the United States. Expanded access to obstetric care through Medicaid, a public health insurance program, aims to address these disparities among racially and economically marginalized birthing people. However, limited research has examined the experiences of women whose obstetric care was covered by Medicaid. This study utilized a birth equity framework informed by reproductive justice principles to analyze interviews with 30 Medicaid-insured women in South Carolina. The analysis focused on study participants’ perceptions of their obstetric care experiences during their most recent pregnancy and hospital stay for labor and delivery. Thematic analysis revealed that participants felt disrespected, dismissed, and ignored by their obstetric care providers. Problems included insurance-related discrimination, insufficient explanations about treatment protocols, mismanagement of pregnancy complications, disregarded pain medication requests, inadequate monitoring of labor progression, and physician absences during delivery. The results substantiate the need for birth equity–informed interventions that facilitate structural competency and cultural humility among medical professionals to improve obstetric care quality among marginalized patients. © 2024 Society for Menstrual Cycle Research.},

	abstract = {There are persistent and profound racialised inequalities in maternal and reproductive health in the UK. Yet in multiple settings, these disparities have been blamed on class or ethnicity, individuals and communities rather than the structures within which they live. In this study, we draw on narratives told within a ‘slow-stitch’ craft workshop, organised in southern England for racialised women with reproductive trauma, to show how processes of racialisation and racism shape experiences of maternal and reproductive healthcare. Experiences of reproductive trauma were multiple and cumulative. The burden of knowledge of racialised disparities was carried into health-care spaces, with plans made in advance to self-manage in risky spaces. The constant management of racialised stereotypes and subsequent strategies of bodily and emotional containment ultimately was not protective and there was little agency over levels of care received in health-care spaces. Perceptions surrounding racialised bodies shaped treatment, whilst proximities to whiteness afforded alternative realities. Taking a phenomenological approach we analyse race as a sensory, spatial and relational constellation haunted by long-standing histories of fraught inequality. Bringing together in the crafting circle a group of women racialised in different ways enabled the sharing of “unspeakable” stories surrounding racism and reproductive trauma, and allowed race to be brought into being as a form of solidarity and connection. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Background: Severe maternal morbidity and mortality are worse in the United States than in all similar countries, with the greatest effect on Black women. Emerging research suggests that disrespectful care during childbirth contributes to this problem. Purpose: To conduct a systematic review on definitions and valid measurements of respectful maternity care (RMC), its effectiveness for improving maternal and infant health outcomes for those who are pregnant and postpartum, and strategies for implementation. Data Sources: Systematic searches of Ovid Medline, CINAHL, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycInfo, and SocINDEX for English-language studies (inception to July 2023). Study Selection: Randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized studies of interventions of RMC versus usual care for effectiveness studies; additional qualitative and noncomparative validation studies for definitions and measurement studies. Data Extraction: Dual data abstraction and quality assessment using established methods, with resolution of disagreements through consensus. Data Synthesis: Thirty-seven studies were included across all questions, of which 1 provided insufficient evidence on the effectiveness of RMC to improve maternal outcomes and none studied RMC to improve infant outcomes. To define RMC, authors identified 12 RMC frameworks, from which 2 main concepts were identified: disrespect and abuse and rights-based frameworks. Disrespect and abuse components focused on recognizing birth mistreatment; rights-based frameworks incorporated aspects of reproductive justice, human rights, and antiracism. Five overlapping framework themes include freedom from abuse, consent, privacy, dignity, communication, safety, and justice. Twelve tools to measure RMC were validated in 24 studies on content validity, construct validity, and internal consistency, but lack of a gold standard limited evaluation of criterion validity. Three tools specific for RMC had at least 1 study demonstrating consistency internally and with an intended construct relevant to U.S. settings, but no single tool stands out as the best measure of RMC. Limitations: No studies evaluated other health outcomes or RMC implementation strategies. The lack of definition and gold standard limit evaluation of RMC tools. Conclusion: Frameworks for RMC are well described but vary in their definitions. Tools to measure RMC demonstrate consistency but lack a gold standard, requiring further evaluation before implementation in U.S. settings. Evidence is lacking on the effectiveness of implementing RMC to improve any maternal or infant health outcome. © 2024 American College of Physicians. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE Physically or psychologically distressing birth experiences can influence postpartum health, parenting efficacy, and future pregnancy plans. Communication deficits contribute to negative birth experiences. This qualitative analysis explored themes related to communication and negative birth experiences among Black birthing people who experienced preterm birth. METHODS We conducted qualitative interviews with non-Hispanic Black, English language– proficient birthing people with Medicaid-insured preterm infants. Interviews were designed to explore experiences with health care access and well-being after birth. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and coded following an integrated approach where we applied a priori codes and captured emergent themes from the data. RESULTS We interviewed 30 participants from October 2018 to July 2021. Median gesta-tional age at birth was 30 weeks (range 22–36 weeks). Interviews occurred a median of 7 months postpartum (range 2–34 months). Themes emerged related to negative birth experiences and communication: (1) communication gaps during urgent or emergent intrapartum procedures contributed to negative birth experiences; (2) postpartum opportunities to share birth experiences, particularly with peers, sometimes mitigated the psychological consequences of negative birth experiences; (3) participants did not consistently discuss concerns about future pregnancy risk related to negative birth experiences with clinical teams. CONCLUSIONS Themes from this sample of Black birthing people who experienced preterm birth suggest 3 ways health systems might intervene to improve communication to mitigate the consequences of negative birth experiences. Improvement efforts in these areas may improve postpartum health, future pregnancy outcomes, and long-term health. © 2024, Annals of Family Medicine, Inc. All rights reserved.},

This paper presents a scoping literature review of the regimes of truth, following Foucault, of ‘sexual justice’ appearing in the scientific literature from 2012 to 2022. Thirty-eight papers were coded using (1) content analysis of the studies’ central problematics, the programmes referred to, and institutional location(s); and (2) thematic analysis of how the notion was deployed. Central problematics centred on (1) critiques of, or alternatives to, dominant approaches to sexual and reproductive health; and (2) highlighting injustices. As such, ‘sexual justice’ is fighting for legitimacy in the truth stakes. There is a distinct paucity of papers tackling the translation of ‘sexual justice’ into practice. South Africa dominates as the site in which papers on ‘sexual justice’ have been produced, but there is a lack of South-South collaboration. Two themes were apparent around which conceptions of sexual justice cohere. Firstly, sexual justice is seen as a vital, yet politically ambivalent goal, with neoliberal co-optation of progressive rights agendas being warned against. Secondly, sexual justice is viewed as a means, in which sexual justice is described as having potential to repair established frameworks’ shortcomings and oppressive legacies. © 2024 The Author(s).

This article provides a grounded look at this reproductive justice organizing in NI as an example of transformative organizing for reproductive futures. The case study considers a conversation with two activists who have been central to this work. Emma Campbell coconvenor of Alliance for Choice and Danielle Roberts the coconvenor of Reclaim the Agenda and former Senior Policy and Development Officer of HERe NI. Reclaim the Agenda is a coalition of feminist, youth, LGBTQ+ and community organizations that connects and mobilizes women to promote feminist activism through education, campaigning and celebration. HERe NI is a community organization and registered charity based in Belfast that supports lesbian and bisexual women and their families across NI. Alliance for Choice campaigns for free, safe legal and local abortion access for everyone who needs it in NI. Together these groups approach reproductive justice using a framework informed by lesbian feminist organizing and an intersectional approach that views access to abortion as part of a broader understanding of gender justice inspired by Black-women led SisterSong through (1) cross-movement organizing (2) centering bodily autonomy and (3) trans affirming feminist approaches to navigating shifting language about gender. The case study will be of interest to those working provide abortion services in a queer-informed way, as well as those navigating the challenges of reforming abortion policy. © 2024 The Author(s).

By constructing maternal health as a problem of managing medicalised risk, the Muskoka Initiative was able to position family planning as a risk-minimising practice that can improve health by averting pregnancy among populations deemed high risk. Interpreting this construction through the lenses of reproductive justice and biopolitics, I argue that this construction contributes to reproductive stratification and exemplifies how medicalised discourses have replaced overt discourses of population control within development policy, while continuing to discourage reproduction among racialised women in the Global South. © The Author(s) 2024.},

In this essay, I build on a growing chorus of intersectionally minded defences of Future Home by exploring how Erdrich’s intertwined representations of Euro-American settler colonialism, ecological and climate crisis, and pregnancy function as gothically dystopian, drawing on politically charged tropes of horrific excess, rot and decay, helpless imprisonment, uncanny doubles, and family curses. The result of Erdrich’s underappreciated experimentation with genre is an Indigenous feminist Gothic theorisation of the terrifying relationship between environmental violence, reproductive oppression, and settler colonial values. © 2024 The Author(s).

The simultaneity of these events sheds light on essential aspects of a transnational order characterized by mass surveillance and detention, a defining feature of diverse contemporary political regimes. This article explores how reproductive violence intertwines with systems of detention and mass surveillance through these two cases. I do so by weaving together the decolonial feminist framework of body-territory and the principles of reproductive justice that allow for a nuanced examination of how the control of the reproductive lives of Uighur and immigrant women reinforce the mechanisms of exclusion and surveillance embedded in state infrastructures. The demand for the right to bear children and to parent them under dignified conditions, free from violence, is increasingly pressing in a world where reproduction has become an instrument of surveillance and containment.

	abstract = {This article explores the role of feminist legal ambivalence in Irish abortion activism, arguing for its continued relevance after the repeal of the Eighth Amendment. Legal ambivalence, which involves a combination of skepticism and engagement with the law, has long been a feature of feminist theory due to the law's role in maintaining patriarchal norms. In the context of Irish abortion advocacy, this ambivalence has provided strategic advantages. Early resistance from the Irish Church and State led activists to approach legal reforms with caution, fostering a productive ambivalence that facilitated actions such as accessing abortions abroad and employing art-based protests. The article outlines how this nuanced stance toward the law evolved over time, benefiting feminist and reproductive rights activism. It argues that Irish abortion advocates should capitalize on this history by advocating for the full decriminalization of abortion. This strategy, the article suggests, carries symbolic power, has been proven advantageous in other countries, and is both pragmatic and feasible in Ireland. Ultimately, the article calls for a continued embrace of legal ambivalence as a tool to challenge restrictive laws and advance reproductive freedom. © 2024 Political Studies Association of Ireland.},

	abstract = {The social construction of pregnancy emphasizes the mother’s responsibility for the developing fetus. Hence, certain activities, such as participation in competitive sport, are often constructed as inappropriate during pregnancy. While expert opinion tends to stress caution, the diversity of athlete mothers’ experiences challenge these dominant discourses. Less is known about how peers and other stakeholders in sport view the participation of pregnant athletes. Knowledge of such attitudes is essential to understanding the position of women in a specific society and the barriers to their autonomy. Hence, we examined survey responses from different sport stakeholders (N = 540) in Finland. Drawing on relational dialectics theory (Baxter, L. A. (2011). Voicing relationships. Sage.), we used contrapuntal analysis to identify different discourses on the compatibility of pregnancy and sport, and their interplay. Three discourses were identified: an equality discourse, which emphasizes that sport belongs to everyone, and that pregnant people should be accepted and supported in sporting environments; a responsibility discourse, which constructs pregnancy as fragility and sport as potentially dangerous for the athlete and the fetus; and an incompatibility discourse, which constructs pregnancy as a disease and unacceptable in sporting environments. Our analysis shows that medicalized, authoritative knowledge is the master strategy used to keep women out of male social spaces during pregnancy. The findings of our study highlight the ongoing struggle for reproductive justice in a patriarchal world order. To advance women’s position in society and support the autonomy of all individuals, viable professional guidelines and organizational policies must be formulated and applied. © The Author(s) 2024.},

Focusing on waste from the pig industry in North Carolina, the article returns to Mills’s essay “Black Trash” to demonstrate the importance of ecology to the racial contract and its renewed relevance. Building on Shatema Threadcraft’s critical engagement with Mills in Intimate Justice, the article concludes that a Black trash feminist approach that foregrounds intimate matters is necessary for ecological resistance. © 2024 The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA.},

Within such a context, this article aims to examine public attitudes toward reproduction and egg-freezing on social media, with particular attention paid to how these discussions reflect the multi-level determinants influencing decision-making regarding egg-freezing practices. Within the context of Chinese gender ideology, we conducted a critical discourse analysis of 1,437 Weibo posts discussing egg-freezing. Our analysis identified four significant themes: reconstructing romantic relationships and family structures, conspiracy theories and distrust surrounding assisted reproduction, exposing and challenging reproductive policies within a patriarchal framework, and interconnections and stratification among women. Accentuated by the egg-freezing discourse, we argue that current Chinese women’s bodily autonomy is entangled with traditional norms and state control, underscoring the intricate interplay between individual choice and societal dynamics, as well as the ideological contradictions at the intersection of Western technological influence and Chinese societal structures. Furthermore, we illuminate the challenging landscape faced by online feminist movements within such a complex context. Our findings set the stage for shaping future initiatives focused on advancing reproductive justice and empowering fertility choices among Chinese women. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {American system of rights is individualized - premised on the concept of singular, physically separate, and autonomous people. The rise of the fetal personhood movement complicates this basic understanding. If rights attach to singular, autonomous people, and fetuses are legally people, then the body of a pregnant person becomes conceptually unintelligible as it contains potentially two, interrelated people. Such a circumstance is fundamentally a contradiction within a framework that insists that rights attach to people who are, by definition, singular, separate, and autonomous. This Article argues that, as a result of this apparent contradiction, fetal personhood laws make the humanity of the pregnant person precarious. If the law has no framework for two rights holders in one body, then the pregnant person must be something else entirely. She becomes less of a subject and more of an object - a reproductive vessel, merely the container for another individual rights-holder. Reproductive justice scholars and advocates have long argued that laws purporting to endow the fetus with personhood exacerbate the "maternal-fetal conflict"and undermine pregnant people's rights. This Article argues, relying on both decades of feminist legal theory and original empirical evidence, that granting full personhood to a fetus has an even more insidious outcome - undermining the legal personhood of women entirely and recategorizing them in the eyes of the law as non-person objects. Looking across cultures and eras, it is unfortunately not difficult to ascertain what might happen when human beings are treated as objects. Such objectification results in almost certain abuse, sometimes of the most horrifying variety.  Copyright © 2024 by Meghan M. Boone and Benjamin J. McMichael.},

And in turn, ‘breaking the silence’ is presented as the means of defeating the stigma. In this article, however, I argue that it is time to abandon the ‘breaking the silence’ frame. This is not only because it overstates the public silence it condemns, but also because it is rooted in an inadequate understanding of stigma, which keeps us stuck in a cycle of talking more, rather than doing more, about miscarriage, and failing to connect miscarriage as a feminist issue with wider struggles for social justice. Drawing on critical sociologies of stigma developed by Imogen Tyler and others, I propose a paradigm shift: from a narrow liberal understanding of miscarriage stigma as a problem of social norms that can be alleviated through ‘breaking the silence’ and ‘awareness raising’, to a critical ‘stigma power’ approach which understands miscarriage stigma as a ‘machinery of inequality’ that fulfils a core function for patriarchal, racialised, neoliberal capitalist power structures, and hence requires transformative socioeconomic solutions. To this end, I call for a new research and activism agenda that fully incorporates miscarriage within the wider movement for Reproductive Justice. © The Author(s) 2024.},

Wade will exacerbate state surveillance and control over pregnancy, the current “pro-choice” rhetoric neglects the state's history of policing reproduction through forced sterilization programs, fetal protection laws, and criminal prosecutions against pregnant persons and caregivers dependent on narcotics. Without a complete understanding of this history and the intersectionality of race, gender, socioeconomic status, disability, and crime, reproductive liberation is not possible. Thus, this Note aims to contribute to existing reproductive justice scholarship and advocacy efforts of women and gender-nonconforming people of color by contextualizing the overturn of Roe within the history of racial eugenics and reproductive punishment. In doing so, this Note uses the history of eugenics and state-sanctioned reproductive oppression to show that abortion is not “a tool of modern-day eugenics,” as conservatives inaccurately proclaim. Adopting a reproductive justice framework is necessary to realize true reproductive freedom. Copyright © 2024 Isabel Jones.},

	abstract = {Effective communication in relation to pregnancy and birth is crucial to quality care. A recent focus in reproductive healthcare on “sexed language” reflects an ideology of unchangeable sex binary and fear of erasure, from both cisgender women and the profession of midwifery. In this paper, we highlight how privileging sexed language causes harm to all who birth—including pregnant trans, gender diverse, and non-binary people—and is, therefore, unethical and incompatible with the principles of midwifery. We show how this argument, which conflates midwifery with essentialist thinking, is unstable, and perpetuates and misappropriates midwifery's marginalized status. We also explore how sex and gender essentialism can be understood as colonialist, heteropatriarchal, and universalist, and therefore, reinforcing of these harmful principles. Midwifery has both the opportunity and duty to uphold reproductive justice. Midwifery can be a leader in the decolonization of childbirth and in defending the rights of all childbearing people, the majority of whom are cisgender women. As the systemwide use of inclusive language is central to this commitment, we offer guidance in relation to how inclusive language in perinatal and midwifery services may be realized. © 2024 The Authors.

It engages with and critiques narrow conceptualizations of reproductive rights and biopolitics and considers the complex ways that abortion legislation becomes embodied in the post-Dobbs era. Mobility is explored across three frames—repression, privilege, and resistance—to highlight the interconnections between reproductive (in)justice and place-based resistance. Situating the analysis within human rights scholarship and reproductive justice and mobilities scholarship, the article outlines the continuities and current configurations of place-based reproductive (in)justice across three interconnected axes. The first axis traces the embodied ramifications of anti-abortion laws for marginalized individuals and communities; the second axis explores the complex personal, political, and economic costs of travelling to access abortion care; and the third axis reflects on historic and current forms of community-based resistance and care. Read together, these axes challenge binary assumptions of agency or subjugation and instead reveal how embodied experiences of abortion restrictions for marginalized individuals and groups also run alongside radical forms of community care to resist these restrictions and address broader forms of lived intersectional inequalities. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Introduction: Perinatal Mood and Anxiety Disorders (PMADs) are the most common complications during the perinatal period. There is limited understanding of the gaps between need and provision of comprehensive health services for childbearing people, especially among racialized populations. Methods: The Giving Voice to Mothers Study (GVtM; n = 2700), led by a multistakeholder, Steering Council, captured experiences of engaging with perinatal services across the United States, including access, respectful care, and health systems’ responsiveness. A patient-designed survey included variables to assess relationships between race, care provider type (midwife or doctor), and needs for psychosocial health services. We calculated summary statistics and tested for significant differences across racialized groups, subsequently reporting odds ratios (ORs) for each group. Results: Among all respondents, 11% (n = 274) reported unmet needs for social and mental health services. Indigenous women were three times as likely to have unmet needs for treatment for depression (OR [95% confidence interval, CI]: 3.1 [1.5–6.5]) or mental health counseling (OR [95% CI]: 2.8 [1.5–5.4]), followed by Black women (OR [95% CI]: 1.8 [1.2–2.8] and 2.4 [1.7–3.4]). Odds of postpartum screening for PMAD were significantly lower for Latina women (OR [95% CI] = 0.6 [0.4–0.8]). Those with midwife providers were significantly more likely to report screening for anxiety or depression (OR [95% CI] = 1.81 [1.45–2.23]) than those with physician providers. Discussion: We found significant unmet need for mental health screening and treatment in the United States. Our results confirm racial disparities in referrals to social services and highlight differences across provider types. We discuss barriers to the integration of assessments and interventions for PMAD into routine perinatal services. Implications: We propose incentivizing reimbursement schema for screening and treatment programs; for community-based organizations that provide mental health and social services; and for culture-centered midwife-led perinatal and birth centers. Addressing these gaps is essential to reproductive justice. © Tanya Khemet Taiwo et al., 2024.},

In this study, the researchers explore provider perspectives of how racism is perpetuated in institutional perinatal and reproductive health care. Methods: Critical Race Theory, Reproductive Justice, and midwifery theory were operationalized through secondary thematic analysis of existing qualitative data from the Community Racial Equity and Training Interventions and Evaluation of Current and Future Healthcare Clinicians Study. Twenty-four perinatal providers (certified nurse-midwives [n = 7] and physicians [n = 17]) voluntarily participated in interviews. A comparative approach was used to determine how professional identity and model of care influence physicians’ and certified nurse-midwives’ perceptions of equity. Results: Thematic analysis produced 5 themes: racism as a comorbidity, health care systems’ inability to address the needs of Black birthing people, health care systems prioritizing providers over patients are failed systems, patients are the experts in the optimal health care model, and benefits of interprofessional teams grounded in Reproductive Justice. Additionally, both physicians and midwives expressed a need for a new care model. Discussion: With these findings, our team proposes a modification of the midwifery model for application by all provider types that could radically shift the experience and outcomes of perinatal and reproductive health care and reduce mortality. Using a human rights approach to care, a Reproductive Justice–Public Health Critical Race praxis–informed midwifery model may be operationalized by all perinatal and reproductive health care providers. This novel model reflects an iterative process that may offer institutions and providers methods to build on past research supporting midwifery-centered care for improving outcomes for all patients by specifically focusing on improving care of Black birthing people.

Participants (n = 13) felt the social needs screening tool was easy to integrate into their clinical workflow and were comfortable using it with patients. All participants reported feeling comfortable administering the tool, scoring it, and referring patients to appropriate resources, if applicable. Most reported they would like to continue using the tool after the pilot implementation period, either with or without modifications.

Human genome and embryo editing, which involve the deliberate alteration of genetic material, hold immense potential for preventing genetic diseases, enhancing human traits, and even addressing infertility. However, these groundbreaking developments come with significant ethical, legal, and social implications that need to be carefully examined and addressed. The absence of a unified global regulatory framework for human genome and embryo editing has created a fragmented landscape. Various countries have adopted different approaches, ranging from strict regulations to more permissive policies.

	abstract = {In the United States, sexual, reproductive, and perinatal health inequities are well documented and known to be caused by a history of systemic oppression along many axes, including but not limited to race, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic position, sexual orientation, and disability. Medical schools are responsible for educating students on systems of oppression and their impact on health. Reproductive justice advocates, including lay persons, medical students, and teaching faculty, have urged for integrating the reproductive justice framework into medical education and clinical practice. In response to medical student advocacy, we developed introductory didactic sessions on social and reproductive justice for preclinical medical students. These were created in a team-based learning format and include pre-course primer materials on reproductive justice. During the sessions, students engaged with hypothetical clinical vignettes in small groups to identify oppressive structures that may have contributed to the health outcomes described and potential avenues for contextually relevant and level-appropriate advocacy. The sessions took place in November 2019 (in-person) and 2020 (virtually) and were well attended by students. We highlight our experience, student feedback, and next steps, including further integration of reproductive health equity into medical school curricula in concert with department-wide education for faculty, residents, nursing, and allied health professionals. This introduction to social and reproductive justice can be adapted and scaled across different medical school curricula, enhancing the training of a new generation of physicians to become critically aware of how oppressive structures create health inequities and able to mitigate their impact through their roles as clinicians, researchers, and advocates. © 2024 The Author(s).

However, recent research has established that LGBTQ+ women have unique and specific needs that need to be addressed in order to improve effectiveness of sexual health education and practice with this historically and presently underserved population. Informed by a reproductive justice framework coupled with liberation psychology theory, this review discusses the current state of sexual and reproductive health and technologies among LGBTQ+ women. In particular, we focus on a range of HIV prevention and reproductive technologies and their use and promotion, including the internal condom, abortion, oral contraceptives, dapivirine ring, HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis, intrauterine device, and other less studied options, such as the contraceptive sponge. Grounded in an intersectional framing, this review acknowledges the intersecting systems of oppression that affect multiply marginalized women inequitably and disproportionately. A sociohistorical, critical lens is applied to acknowledge the well-documented racist origins of reproductive health technologies and ongoing coercive practices that have led to medical mistrust among marginalized and stigmatized communities, particularly racialized LGBTQ+ women, women with disabilities, and women who are poor or incarcerated. Moreover, we discuss the urgent need to center LGBTQ+ women in research and clinical care, community-engaged health promotion efforts, affirming non-heteronormative sexual health education, and health policies that prioritize autonomy and dismantle structural barriers for this population. We conclude with recommendations and future directions in this area to remedy entrenched disparities in health. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

This paper engages a reproductive justice framework to investigate the (mis)alignment of a maternity care desert within a predominantly Black rural community in the United States. I draw on a case study of Gadsden County, Florida—a community that is perceived by its members to be a maternity care desert but that is not technically defined as one—to demonstrate how Black birthing people are cultivating a reproductive liberatory consciousness. Semi-structured interviews with birthing persons and reproductive health experts reveal three overarching processes—naming barriers to health equity, resisting health inequity and cultivating health equity—that characterise a reproductive liberatory consciousness, which I identify as an analytical tool to outline how local social actors are identifying structural constraints as well as developing strategies of communal care and resistance. This work contributes to sociological research on reproductive justice and health equity by exploring the limitations of ‘desert’ frameworks. Pointing to the need to carefully consider the mechanisms that actively disrupt and potentially transform spatial stratifications and inequities, this paper advances a new understanding of birthing space that captures the layered movements of those living within a perceived maternity care desert. © 2024 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness.},

	abstract = {Young people account for over half of new STI cases and youth of color face increased sexual health disparities. In partnership with Fact Forward, researchers conducted qualitative formative audience research to develop a culture-centered health communication campaign to increase access to and use of sexual health services among youth of color in South Carolina. Grounded in a reproductive justice theoretical framework, this study employed innovative strategies, including training youth ambassadors to moderate peer-to-peer focus groups. A total of 134 participants were recruited for the study with 51 individuals participating in 9 focus groups and 83 respondents completing a web-based survey (ages 15-24). Qualitative data analyses used Nvivo 1.5.1. Statistical analyses used R Studio®. Findings revealed barriers including lack of education about risks. Participants identified dimensions of inequity and the importance of intersectional messaging to address intimacy, sexuality, and trust. They emphasized normalizing conversations about sexual health and the need for important others “in your corner” to provide support. Participants suggested an empowering storytelling approach to reduce shame surrounding sexual health services. Social media emerged as an optimal communication channel. UNC Perceived Message Effectiveness (PME) Scale scores ranged from 4.42 to 4.57 (out of 5) indicating that messages were well received by participants. Sex-positive campaign messaging focused on self-love, empowerment, and taking control of sexual health. This study offers practical suggestions to develop effective communication strategies to reach youth of color to increase use of sexual health services, including contraceptive counseling, STI prevention, screening, and treatment. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {The Centering Equality, Race, and Cultural Literacy in Family Planning (CERCL-FP) program aims to break racial silence and dismantle structural racism in the field of family planning, by providing racial equity workshops and trainings. Objective: The objective of this study was to begin a multi-phased, rigorous evaluation to determine the impact and outcomes of the work of CERCL-FP. Study design: A needs assessment with former graduates and current directors of fellowships in family planning was conducted using qualitative interviews. The focus of these interviews was to determine the ability, readiness, and willingness of the field of family planning to retrofit new curricula grounded in equity, race, and cultural literacy. Results: Nine (N = 9) interviews were completed with seven board certified obstetrician-gynecologists and two board certified family medicine physicians. Three themes were identified: (1) Establishing the Distribution of Work; (2) The Push/Pull of Change from Inside and Outside: Curricula and Faculty Responsibilities; and (3) Reproductive Justice and Fellowships in Family Planning. Despite acknowledging the need to retrofit the field of family planning with content grounded in equity, race, and cultural literacy, there are structural, institutional, and individual level barriers that have limited the adoption of CERCL-FP curricula within family planning curriculum nationwide. Conclusion: Findings from this study illuminate multiple barriers that should be considered when expanding foundational knowledge of clinicians and researchers. Implications: Similar to the slow integration of research findings into clinical practice, this study shows that integration of social science and new curricula within the field of family planning faces significant barriers. Strategies to address these barriers are crucial to ensuring successful integration of equity, race, and cultural literacy within family planning. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.},

This article explores the historical development, integration, and implications of the contemporary life course perspective in the field of maternal and child health (MCH), and particularly the people and events which institutionalized the framework as central to national and local MCH practice and research over the last decades. Methods: Drawing on an oral history approach, key leaders of the life course movement in MCH were interviewed. Lived experiences and personal recollections of six interviewees were recorded and synthesized using a narrative descriptive approach to portray the social ecology of the movement’s origins. Results: We documented systematic efforts made in the first two decades of the 21st century to consciously promote life course through convening a National MCH Life Course Invitational Meeting, incorporating life course as a foundational framework for strategic planning at the Maternal Child Health Bureau, and development of tools and resources by MCH professional organizations. Discussion: The integration of life course theory into the MCH field signified a major shift towards addressing protective and social factors, which aligns with the field’s historical emphasis on social justice and rights-based approaches, and parallels the broader public health movement towards social determinants of health and the need to address structural racism. The ongoing relevance of the life course approach in promoting reproductive justice and addressing inequities in health underscores the historical importance of its adoption and use in the current mainstream of MCH research, policy, and practice. © The Author(s) 2024.},

The use of egg freezing has grown in popularity since the American Society for Reproductive Medicine lifted its experimental label in 2012. However, while the technology has been increasingly used for non-medical reasons, it remains important to consider its implications for social inequalities in contemporary societies. To understand such implications of egg freezing, we must consider the wider landscape of reproductive technologies and the social groups affected by them. Access to reproductive technologies is stratified in Turkey, with some social groups able to afford cross-border reproductive travel, as gamete donation and surrogacy are legally prohibited, and IVF is only allowed to married couples. The chapter highlights intersectional perspectives on reproduction, including concepts such as reproductive justice and stratified reproduction, and discusses the topic drawing on the author’s ongoing research on women’s experiences of egg freezing in Turkey. The chapter concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding the social inequalities and institutional constraints that affect the use of reproductive technologies. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024, corrected publication 2024.},

The decision directly impacts the way social work educators address current social issues that relate to bodily autonomy and social justice. This paper used mixed methodology to collect quantitative and qualitative survey data from MSW students to explore how they perceive the overturning of Roe v. Wade, how the topic was covered in their social work courses, and receive recommendations on how it should be taught. Constructivist Grounded Theory and Thematic Analysis were used to code for reoccurring and emergent themes. Findings indicate that students believe the Dobbs decision was not discussed enough in social work courses, that students believe reproductive justice discussions should be grounded in NASW values, and that students view the Dobbs decision negatively. Student suggestions for teaching reproductive justice are to focus on educational information, try to avoid politics, and set a civil classroom tone. The aim of this research study is to elevate the voices of students as educators grapple with navigating how the Dobbs decision impacts micro- and macro-level curriculum. © 2024 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {Antimicrobial Resistance is a threat to individual and to population health and to future generations, requiring “collective sacrifices” in order to preserve antibiotic efficacy. ‘Who should make the sacrifices?’ and ‘Who will most likely make them?’ are ethical concerns posited as potentially manageable through Antimicrobial Stewardship. Antimicrobial stewardship almost inevitably involves a form of clinical cost-benefit analysis that assesses the possible effects of antibiotics to treat a diagnosed infection in a particular patient. However, this process rarely accounts properly for patients – above and beyond assessments of potential (non)compliance or adherence to care regimes. Drawing on a vignette of a pregnant woman of colour and migrant diagnosed with Mycoplasma genitalium, a sexually transmissible bacterium, this article draws out some of the ethical, speculative, and practical tensions and complexities involved in Antimicrobial Stewardship. We argue that patients also engage in a form of cost-benefit analysis influenced by experiences of reproductive and social (in)justice and comprising speculative variables - to anticipate future possibilities. These processes have the potential to have effects above and beyond the specific infection antimicrobial stewardship was activated to address. We contend that efforts to practice and research antimicrobial stewardship should accommodate and incorporate these variables and acknowledge the structures they emerge with(in), even if their components remain unknown. This would involve recognising that antimicrobial stewardship is intricately connected to other social justice issues such as immigration policy, economic justice, access to appropriate medical care, racism, etc. © The Author(s) 2024.},

In the context of recently experiencing birth complications, parents needed a space where they were able to focus on physical and mental healing.

	abstract = {Black perinatal mental health is an area that has received less focus in psychotherapy research in the United States. This area is especially important as recent attacks on Reproductive Justice impact not only birthing people’s rights and freedoms but also their mental health and emotional well-being. Current psychotherapy interventions are rooted in evidence-based treatments (EBTs) that may not always align with the values and practices of frameworks like radical healing and liberation psychology that are meant to emphasize collective healing and empower individuals. To date, psychological research involving radical healing and liberation psychology approaches have not had a specific focus on birthing people. Psychotherapeutic interventions have also largely excluded the unique intersectional identities and healing of Black birthing people. In moving toward decolonizing psychotherapy, this conceptual paper will propose a multi-pronged framework for addressing racial stressors and other mental health concerns during the perinatal period. The proposed framework, The Three Cs of Decolonization, includes three components: Community, Creativity, and Connection to Self. These components of the framework are meant to address and highlight culturally relevant ways of healing for Black birthing people. Larger systemic changes are needed and necessary for the desired change across mental health, medical, and other integrated systems of care that have been impacted by racism and discrimination. The current framework is dedicated to healing and empowering Black birthing people with approaches and considerations that are consistent with Reproductive Justice. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Purpose: As uterine transplantation (UTx) shifts from an experimental fertility treatment toward standard of care, ethical considerations in expanding access to UTx beyond currently eligible recipients merit attention. We conducted a scoping review to map existing scholarship on the ethics of candidacy for UTx beyond cisgender female recipients. Methods: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR), five databases were searched (PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, Scopus, and CINAHL) from database inception to June 24, 2022. Following title, abstract, and full-text screening, data were extracted and charted to identify thematic patterns and identify gaps in scholarship. Results: Thirty-two articles were included in the final sample. Issues of justice figured most prominently. Common themes included the right to gestate for transgender women and beyond, the possibility of increased surgical and medical risks for other recipient populations, and attendant moral obligation to expand access to UTx if additive risks are mitigated. Equity considerations were also frequently cited, along with the value of gestation in female identity and its role in defining womanhood. Conclusion: Discourse on the ethics of expanding eligibility for UTx is still emerging. Areas for further consideration include exploring the relation of gestation to identity and gender, clarifying the need for further research on safety and efficacy of UTx in other recipient populations, assessing desire for UTx among individuals other than cisgender women, and addressing sustainable funding. This scoping review can inform efforts to develop equitable eligibility criteria for access to UTx moving forward. © 2024, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.},

We use the sociological framework of “strategic ignorance” to argue that convenient not knowing, erasure, and concealment simultaneously prevent and facilitate abortions in Latin America. By drawing on interviews with people involved in abortion activism and access across the continent, we examine three sets of actors: the state, abortion providers, and individuals seeking abortions. When wielded by the state, strategic ignorance reproduces the status quo of the criminalization of abortion; however, when wielded by abortion providers and individuals seeking abortions, it creates the conditions for “clandestine” abortions to be procured without prosecution. Strategic ignorance is therefore mobilized by the powerful as well as the less powerful who are resisting state control of their fertility and reproductive lives. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {We discuss reproductive justice in the context of Finland, a Nordic welfare state often considered as having achieved exceptionally high ethical standards in reproductive health and overall justice. Every now and then, however, this reproduction is interrupted by ghosts in the machine: the problems, past and present, of marginalised, racialised, and/or otherwise non-normative people whose presences provoke specific Finnish hauntings, seething presences of reproductive injustice that suggest something is to be done. Instead of offering data analysis, this article aims to envision transformative reproductive justice futures through processual, collaborative theory development. This study uses an intersectional lens to understand how interlocking systems of oppression shape our lived experiences through an interdisciplinary, ethical analysis that suggests that what is required to resolve such hauntings is moral vigilance and care for a consistent reproductive justice orientation in global solidarity. Specifically in Finland, it requires the willingness to disavow the imperative to protect Finnish whiteness and active and meaningful solidarity across differences. Building on Black feminist and queer thought, we urge queer white people who may be tempted to become enfolded by homonationalism to take a more encompassing view of reproductive justice for a more sustainable welfare state ethic. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Background: Some individuals who receive long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) face barriers to discontinuation. The inability to discontinue a contraceptive method when desired negatively impacts a person’s reproductive autonomy. Persons impacted by social determinants of health (SDH) may be disproportionately affected. The objective of this study is to evaluate the association of SDH with patient-reported difficult LARC discontinuation. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional analysis of data from the 2017–2019 cycle of the National Survey of Family Growth was conducted. The main outcome was patient-reported difficulty discontinuing a LARC method (intrauterine device or implant) in the last 10 years. Descriptive statistics were used to identify demographic characteristics and SDH domains. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate associations across SDH domains with difficult LARC removal. Results: A total of 754 respondents reported wanting to have their LARC removed, and 105 (11%) reported difficulty discontinuing LARC methods. One-third of respondents experienced one or more SDH, notably food insecurity (26%) or transportation barriers (30%). After adjusting for age, race, education, geographic location, parity, and body mass index (BMI), persons with one or more SDH had an increased adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for difficultly discontinuing LARCs compared with respondents without any SDH (2.11; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.21, 3.69). Transportation barriers demonstrated the largest aOR of 2.90 (95% CI: 1.07, 7.87). Conclusions: SDH are associated with challenges to LARC discontinuation. SDH are unique risk factors that can impact one’s entire contraceptive experience. A nuanced discussion of SDH at the time of contraceptive counseling may be a critical step in addressing the intersectionality of method selection and reproductive agency. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

Evidence has shown that provision of these rights not only improves maternal and neonatal health, but also healthcare worker safety and the provision of a vast array of critical and necessary medical care. And yet, too often—and with increasing frequency—sexual and reproductive rights are being violated worldwide, with rising taboos, stigma, and discrimination, particularly within abortion, contraception, and fertility care. FIGO strongly supports comprehensive, equitable, and accessible sexual and reproductive health care for all individuals, recognizing that these rights are essential components of global health and fundamental human rights. This includes a particular emphasis on special populations, healthcare workers, and women and girls in crisis zones. FIGO encourages its member societies to deliver comprehensive sexual and reproductive health care, advocate for coverage for sexual and reproductive health care, become involved in analyzing barriers to access within health systems, and provide nonjudgemental, confidential, person-centered care. © 2024 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.},

This conveniently ignores the inherent contradictions of the existence of only limited access to abortion in many Western nations, as well as parallel histories of access to reproductive justice in non-Western countries. Postcolonial Ireland, as an apparently Western country with a renowned history of anti-feminist legislation, has existed as one of these contradictions. In this article, we examine Irish feminists’ familial storytelling to reveal how they managed their contradictory position in a teleological narrative that positioned Western feminism as the epitome of progress. We adopt a comparative approach–looking at the lead up to the introduction of the Eighth Amendment of the Irish Constitution in 1983, which awarded the foetus constitutional rights, and then the high profile Repeal the 8th movement that successfully revoked that amendment in 2018–to understand reproductive rights activists’ changing uses of “the family” to effect intergenerational and transnational solidarity. Applying Sara Ahmed’s concept of “sticky” emotions, we examine how feminists transformed “the Irish family” from a site of coldness and despair to one of hope, dignity, humanity and happiness. © 2024 The Author(s).

Brimming with feminist epiphanies, this social justice playbook is an urgent call for women’s collective leadership to guide humanity through the gravest of challenges, overcoming patriarchy’s multi-millennium reign through the uprising of women leaders and philanthropists. Founded during the second-wave women’s movement of the early 1970s, small groups of women across the world, independent of each other, had the same epiphany: it will take a movement of women to raise the money needed to fund women’s freedom. Since then, the Global Women’s Funding Movement has grown into a global network of radically generous, risk-taking philanthropists who collectively wield financial might to win seismic gender equality victories. The authors document the “Women Effect” that results from gender equality and women’s collective leadership, including improved public health and reproductive justice, expanded public education, stronger democracies, resilient economies, climate recovery and enduring peace. The Global Women’s Funding Movement is guided by its Feminist Funding Principles and, through them, it has innovated the most effective philanthropic practices, including trust-based philanthropy. The Uprising of Women in Philanthropy is for those interested in focusing the power of philanthropy on leveraging systemic social justice victories and gender equality gains. The long-practiced Feminist Funding Principles imparted by the authors is a recipe for the feminist alchemy needed to transform society for the betterment of all. The Uprising of Women in Philanthropy is written in a collective voice and is also, we believe, an important human rights document. It offers a roadmap to achieve a thriving democracy. This book marks the first time that women’s rights philanthropists have united, in book form and in one voice, to call for massive investments in women’s rights for social justice change. The Uprising of Women in Philanthropy will be an important addition to the works of the few, but highly influential, feminist collective authorships. © 2025 Ndana Bofu-Tawamba, Ruby Bright, Stephanie Clohesy, Christine Grumm, Musimbi Kanyoro, Helen LaKelly Hunt, Ana Oliveira, Laura Risimini, Jane Sloane, and Jessica Tomlin.},

The historical context of prior and contemporary perspectives around childbirth influences our understanding of RMC and are shaped by varying scholarly, clinical, and community standards (e.g., religion, human rights, government, public health, midwifery, ethics, activism, and the law), which have changed significantly since the mid-19th century. In this commentary, we share results of a contextual question scoped as part of a larger systematic review of RMC to help inform consensus around a shared definition and development of a metric to standardize delivery and evaluation of RMC. Synthesis of this literature identified landmark historical influences on RMC over the past 100 years, highlighting the multidisciplinary scholarship and historical context influencing the progress toward RMC. Further understanding of this history may also inform policies and guidance for ongoing efforts to center respect and accountability in all aspects of maternity care, with particular attention to populations who are disproportionally impacted by disrespectful care. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

The article challenges these anachronistic and revisionist histories, which ignore Wollstonecraft's life experiences and wider corpus. Especially in her late novel, The Wrongs of Woman, abortion is both a prominent metaphor for the book as a whole and a crucial narrative event for both heroines. I argue that Wollstonecraft's life, work, and ethical commitments, particularly her advocacy for “rights against domination” and “for the cause of virtue,” make her a fitting historical ally to contemporary advocates of reproductive justice who see women's rights to abortion and maternity as among the many important issues for women's health and reproductive justice. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

We argue that intersectional feminist lenses and gender-sensitive responses are necessary to build effective efforts for women and girls during a public health emergency. As such, we present three concomitant and intersectional learned tactics we used to fight for reproductive justice during the Zika crises, but also in its aftermath: 1. To build storytelling narratives that portray the disproportional effects of the crisis on women and girls; 2. To produce evidence-based data to catalyze advocacy strategies for legal and policy review; 3. To promote movement building opportunities and sharing power through community mobilization activities. We assume the importance of providing immediate evidence and gender sensitive framings to inform real-time public health responses. Advocacy efforts should not be seen as fragmented strategies, since ensuring reproductive justice demands a comprehensive and transformative framework that include solutions for multiple aspects of real-life experiences. © 2024, Institute de Medicina Social da UERJ.

	abstract = {Federal Indian policy is rooted in family regulation. Here, family regulation is twofold, comprising: (1) the idea that American Indian families should be curated to be more like their non-Indian counterparts; and (2) the child welfare system, as Dorothy Roberts notes. Overall, family regulation was part of an Indian assimilation project. Since the late nineteenth century, assimilationist tactics encouraged the wholesale removal of Indian children, first to boarding schools, and later to adoptive placements. After decades of abusive family regulation practices, Congress enacted the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (“ICWA”) to prevent the breakup of Indian families and promote tribal sovereignty. This Article argues that, in addition to the expressed congressional goal of protecting Indian families, ICWA is a tool of reproductive justice. Beyond the right to abortion, reproductive justice includes the right to have a child, the right to not have a child, and the right to raise a child in a safe and healthy environment. By implementing procedural guidelines to protect Indian family decision-making and child-rearing from state agencies that were, and are, often too eager to promote the settler colonial project, ICWA is a positive disruption of the settler colonial project that defends the reproductive autonomy of American Indian people. As a symbol of the disruption of both historic and contemporary efforts to regulate Indian families through a colonial project that defined families through assimilation, and regulated those it could not, ICWA remains a good policy. Yet, ICWA is under attack like other reproductive rights and the rights of Indian tribes as sovereigns. As such, this Article provides a framework for reproductive rights and explains where ICWA—and more specifically, the needs of American Indians—fit into this framework. Because ICWA does not exist without other attacks on the reproductive autonomy of American Indians and tribal sovereignty, this Article examines the attendant history of the settler colonial project leading up to ICWA, as well as ICWA’s goals and mandate, along with what it means to discuss ICWA as a tool of reproductive justice. While opponents frame their attacks on ICWA as a need to “save” Indian children and place them with the “best” families possible, the attacks on ICWA symbolize the ongoing attempts to regulate Indians by eroding their reproductive rights and autonomy. © 2024 Boston University Law Review.

	abstract = {Consider the following about your own theatre-making practices: How do you practice interconnectedness, reciprocity, repair and truth-telling, and does this practice preserve existing/harmful power relations? How is your practice interwoven with decolonization, tribal sovereignty, intersectional feminism, transnational feminism, climate justice, racial justice, reproductive justice, disability justice, anti-capitalism, anti-imperialism, reparations, labor movements, the art, activism, and cultural production of peoples of the global majority, and all freedom and liberation struggles? How does your practice expose and fuel the ways theatre brings the abolitionist imagination to reality? Extension opportunity: Embodied exercise To whom are you interconnected? Participants take a short time to freewrite connections to familial, theatre-making, and/or community organizing ancestors in their lineage. This lineage should include those who came before them, those they work alongside, and those who come after. They are encouraged to imagine encounters with their ancestors, including particular guidance, wisdom, and stories. After the visualization, participants have the option to share their experiences, feelings, and reflections. What’s the impact of consciously welcoming the historied connections of your work with others? Are there overlaps in the lineages of the room? How might that impact the time the group needs to develop trust? How might you continue to honor your past as you work toward your future?. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Rivka Eckert and Lizbett Benge; individual chapters, the contributors.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Policy decisions about young people’s sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) have far-reaching implications for their well-being. Few SRHR policies, however, focus specifically on youth. Rather, youth SRHR tends to be subsumed within national policies of Health, Youth, Education and Development Ministries, particularly in the Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA) region, complicating an assessment of the overall state of youth SRHR policies. Given the fact that youth SRHR policies focus on a particular segment of the population—youth, teenagers or adolescents—how policies depict these subjects has implications for how policy objectives, programmes and interventions are conceptualised and the kind of sexual and reproductive health concerns that are prioritised. Methods: Using a subject positioning lens, our critical review of youth SRHR policy in force between 2010 and 2020 spans policy domains to examine depictions of young people across 88 ESA policy documents. Our analysis aimed to identify the qualities and responsibilities associated with different youth subject positions and the broader implications thereof for young people’s SRHR. Results: We identify two dominant youth subject positions—risky youth and youth-at-risk—both of which construct risk as inherent to young people, overwhelmingly emphasise negative repercussions of youth sexual practices, foreground individualised interventions and hold young people responsible for preventing negative sexual and reproductive health (SRH) outcomes in the absence of policy objectives that meaningfully address structural constraints on their agency. Conclusions: Considering the dominance of public health research underpinning youth SRHR, our findings contribute a much-needed critical social theory complement that supports holistic, justice-oriented and contextually embedded policy responses to young people’s SRHR. Policy Implications: Based on our findings, we provide policy recommendations that support a conceptual shift away from vulnerable youth to vulnerabilising contexts, such that young people’s vulnerability to adverse SRH outcomes is situated in the enabling and constraining conditions in which they live their lives. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Background: Due to high rates of unintended pregnancies in Delaware, the state launched a public health initiative in 2014 to increase access to contraceptive services. Objectives: This study was designed to assess the practice-level barriers and facilitators to providing contraceptive care, particularly long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs), to adolescents in primary care settings. Design: This qualitative study was part of a larger process evaluation of the Delaware Contraceptive Access Now (DelCAN) initiative. Methods: In-depth, semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 16 practice administrators at 13 adolescent-serving primary care sites across the state of Delaware. A process of open, axial, and selective coding was used to analyze the data. Results: Despite the interest in LARC among their adolescent patients, administrators described numerous barriers to providing LARC for adolescents including confidentiality in patient visits and billing, preceptorship, and provider discomfort and assumptions about the need for contraception among adolescent patients. Conclusion: Findings from this study reveal substantial barriers to providing contraception to adolescents, even in primary care practices that were committed to comprehensive contraceptive access for their adolescent patients. This study supports the need for contraceptive care to be integrated into training of pediatricians at every stage of their education. Such training must go beyond education about contraceptive options and the clinical skills necessary for LARC insertion and removal, to include counseling skills based in a reproductive justice framework. Additional changes in policies and practices for adolescent patients would further increase access to contraceptive care. © The Author(s) 2024.},

The objectives of this qualitative study were to identify successes, challenges, and areas of growth for the Coalition and develop broadly generalizable recommendations for similar groups seeking to mobilize and advance health equity in their own communities. Methods: Using purposive sampling, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 key informants from within and outside of the Coalition. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, and data was analyzed using inductive and deductive coding approaches. Results: We identified themes relating to the barriers and facilitators to the maintenance of the Coalition, as well as opportunities to advance the mission of the Coalition. Some themes included structural- and systemic-level barriers to achieving the mission, varying perspectives on the effectiveness of the Coalition, opportunities to enhance the operations of the Coalition’s work, and opportunities to involve other individuals, particularly those with lived experience, and non-MCH related sectors in Coalition’s work. Conclusions for Practice: As the maternal health crisis continues, coalitions like the New Orleans MCH Coalition provide a vehicle to amplify the mission-driven work of people and organizations. Recommendations put forth by the Coalition can also be utilized by coalitions in other jurisdictions. © The Author(s) 2024.},

First, we situate the issue in relation to contemporary and historical migration processes and regimes of mobility. Second, we discuss how the articles in this issue explore the rhythms of gig work in relation to the spatio-temporalities of migration regimes and cities increasingly built on a logic of fulfilment.

The decision most significantly affects communities that historically have been and continue to be marginalized by systemic racism, classism, and ableism within the medical system. To minimize the harm of restrictive policies that have proliferated since the Supreme Court overturned Roe, it is incumbent on obstetrician-gynecologists to modify practice patterns to meet the pressing reproductive health needs of their patients and communities. Change will require cross-discipline advocacy focused on advancing equity and supporting the framework of reproductive justice. Now, more than ever, obstetrician-gynecologists have a critical responsibility to implement new approaches to service delivery and education that will expand access to evidence-based, respectful, and person-centered family planning and early pregnancy care regardless of their practice location or subspecialty. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Population size is a significant variable that can be addressed to help combat climate change. If global fertility rates dropped by only 0.5 births per woman, almost a third of the emissions needed to avoid catastrophic climate change could be saved. This is equivalent to the annual emissions that would be saved from doubling the fuel efficiency of cars, increasing wind energy 50-fold or improving nuclear energy three times over. It accounts for over half of the Earth's yearly emissions. Yet, is there a way to address population size without violating human rights? To what extent should individual reproductive practices change? These are live questions. However, various philosophers claim that procreators should limit themselves to having no more than one child. Doing so, they say, strikes the most appropriate balance between protecting reproductive justice for people who want to have children and achieving a sustainable future. This paper pushes back on this claim. There are plausibly too many sexist, racist, classist and eugenic outcomes in demanding people limit their procreation to one child. Therefore, philosophers should relax their messaging about permissibility limits and be more concerned with helping people cultivate the right character to think through procreation and overpopulation. © The Author(s), 2024.

However, the influence of racism on sexual health has not been well-described in qualitative studies. The purpose of this study was to explore definitions of structural racism and determine how experiences of racial discrimination impact sexual health and decision-making in a sample of adolescent Black girls. Methods: Black girls aged 13–19 years were recruited from an ongoing longitudinal study. Virtual focus groups and individual interviews were facilitated, inquiring about understandings of structural racism, experiences with discrimination, and factors that influence sexual health decision-making and healthcare-seeking. Transcripts were professionally transcribed and coded by two independent, blinded team members. Thematic content analysis was used to identify emergent themes. Results: Four themes emerged as follows: (1) slavery and medical racism in the United States impact the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) choices of Black girls; (2) stereotypes and oversexualization of Black girls are considered a barrier to SRH education; (3) adults serve as both barriers and facilitators to SRH and resource utilization; and (4) Black girls often seek information from friends or social media outlets to make SRH decisions. Discussion: Reproductive health education for Black girls should integrate historical influences of systemic oppression. Practitioners should include reproductive justice to build trust in clinical and community spaces.

In this study, we analyze student perceptions of a hypothetical campus rape in which a victim experiences no medical consequences, becomes pregnant, or contracts a sexually transmitted infection (STI) as a result of rape. Students in the sample recommended consistently severe punishment for the perpetrator across all three experimental conditions but viewed victim guilt and responsibility to be greatest for the rape resulting in pregnancy and least for the rape resulting in an STI. Qualitatively, students voiced strong sympathy for the victim due to the STI, yet rarely discussed the impact of pregnancy. We recommend that future research investigate the perceptions, prevalence, and consequences of reproductive health outcomes resulting from campus rape and suggest a reproductive justice framework for doing so. © 2024 Alpha Kappa Delta: The International Sociology Honor Society.},

Their analysis leads them to engage indigenous reproductive justice organizing; that engagement is the focus of my critique. I argue that their understanding of the biopolitical targeting of indigenous people needs further development. Diprose and Ziarek tend to read indigenous organizers as working toward inclusion in the democratic plurality of settler societies. While that is the aim of some indigenous organizations and actors, that is not the aim of many, including a theorist and activist they engage, Katsi Cook (Mohawk). I suggest that their engagement with indigenous reproductive justice organizing is shaped by the important, but unthematized role settler colonialism has in Arendt's work. I further argue that Cook provides crucial theoretical and practical challenges to the settler state and its role in feminist theoretical projects of critique. © The Author(s), 2024.},

Research shows that interlocking complex social disadvantage and ableist professional attitudes toward parenting by people with intellectual disabilities persist, leading to very high rates of child protection and child removal. The approach taken by the Commission to examination of violence, abuse, neglect, and exploitation against parents with disabilities as a group led to the invisibility of parents with intellectual disabilities within the Final Report. The life course approach was narrowly conceived and did not fully capture reproductive justice across the life course. The issue of parenting and child protection contact was primarily considered in relation to First Nations families, which brought critical attention to some aspects of systemic violence and abuse, but issues and experiences of non-Indigenous parents with intellectual disabilities were absent. We argue that these and other flaws prevented the Commission from making important recommendations in relation to legal and policy reform to uphold the rights of people with intellectual disabilities to become parents and to receive the support they need for parenting over the life course. © 2024 The Author(s).

The 2022 Dobbs decision returned questions about the legality of abortion to the states, which increased the importance of state laws for abortion access. The objective of this study is to illustrate trends in abortion-restrictive and abortion-supportive state laws using a unique longitudinal database of reproductive health laws across the United States from 1994 to 2022. This study offers a descriptive analysis of historical trends in state-level pre-viability abortion bans, abortion method bans, efforts to dissuade abortion,TRAP (targeted regulation of abortion providers) laws, other laws that restrict reproductive choice, and laws that expand abortion access and support reproductive health. Data sources include state statutes (from Nexis Uni) and secondary sources. The data reveal that pre-viability bans, including gestation-based bans and total bans, became significantly more prevalent over time. Other abortion-restrictive laws increased from 1994 to 2022, but states also passed a growing number of laws that support reproductive health. Increasing polarization into abortion-restrictive and abortionsupportive states characterized the 1994-2022 period. These trends have implications for maternal and infant health and for racial/ethnic and income disparities.  © 2023 by Duke University Press.},

The present study examines how contextual factors shape pregnancy and childbirth experiences for Syrian, Afghan, Congolese, and Karen women living in Clarkston, Georgia, US. Qualitative data were collected via focus groups facilitated by community interpreters. We used a reproductive justice framework to center women's desires, needs, and experiences, and to highlight the importance of structural factors in the findings and analysis of this study. Using codebook thematic analysis, three themes were developed: (1) isolation and alienated knowledge, (2) gendered disparities and structural inequities, and (3) community support and precarity. The findings reflect both the diversity and constancy of women's experiences and highlight how the context of the US impacts women's ability to exercise agency during pregnancy and childbirth. Systemic change is needed to improve women's access to tools that increase their capacity to exercise agency both during pregnancy and childbirth, and beyond. © The Author(s) 2023.},

What role does the exceptionalisation of reproductive rights play in the reproduction of the nation-state? Nicaragua and Sweden are countries where debates about reproductive justice highlight tensions in the projection of a state that cares for its citizens: Nicaragua, the second-poorest country in the Western Hemisphere with one of the most repressive and punitive legislations on abortion in the world, and Sweden with its reputation as a pioneering nation in matters of gender equality and reproductive justice. This chapter draws on a particular formulation of the centrality of the state in theories and practices of reproductive justice: the notion of the state as a parent with a particular responsibility to protect and foster, but also discipline and subjugate, its citizens. Political leaders, Fathers and Mothers of the Nation, form the discourse within which the state regulates its imagined children's, the citizens, reproductive rights. As such the governance of reproduction is a vital aspect of the political fantasy about the nation-state and its futuriority. © The Author(s) 2023. All rights reserved.},

In this essay, I argue that Dobbs and subsequent policies have created a significant need for educational research to inform courts, public policy, and practice to improve social and educational structural support for marginalized students who can carry pregnancies in a post-Dobbs era. This need is because Dobbs and subsequent policies have significantly diminished reproductive justice, and reproductive justice is intricately tied to marginalized students’ ability to fully engage in their education.

	abstract = {Abortion is a common but controversial phenomenon globally. The discourse on the legality of abortion remains intricate, leaving a substantial number of women restricted from accessing safe abortion. There are evidence of an association between restrictive abortion laws, unsafe abortions, and maternal mortality in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). We explore how restrictive abortion laws violate women’s right to health and bodily integrity. We used Carol Bacchi’s policy framework to analyze how restrictive abortion laws have been discursively framed (problematization); the assumptions that underpinned the representation; the consequences of the representation; what was left unproblematic; how the representation could be questioned, disrupted and replaced. We found that most of these laws are based on morality and the limited number of women in politics has made them objects rather than subjects in decision-making process. Therefore, we recommend a holistic approach to abortion laws with women leading the process to achieve reproductive justice. © 2021 The Author(s).

The world should be outraged given that we have known the key interventions necessary for preventing MMM for over three-quarters of a century. Since the 1990s, human rights advocacy on MMM has gained crucial ground, demonstrating that entitlements related to maternal health are judicially enforceable and delineating rights-based approaches to health in the context of MMM. Nonetheless, evident retrogressions, coupled with ballooning social inequalities, redoubled austerity post-pandemic, and a conservative populist backlash against reproductive rights, underscore the steep challenges we face. This paper offers five lessons gleaned from what we have achieved during the past 30 years of human rights advocacy on maternal health, and where we have fallen short: (1) maternal health is not a technical challenge alone and is inseparable from reproductive justice; (2) reproductive justice requires strengthening health system infrastructures; (3) we must center the political economy of global health in our advocacy, not just national policies; (4) litigation is part of a larger advocacy toolkit, not a go-it-alone strategy; and (5) we must use metrics that tell us why women are dying and what to do. © 2023 Yamin.},

	abstract = {Purpose of review Mobile health outreach programs are an alternative way to provide family planning services for rural populations or populations affected by conflict, outbreaks, or humanitarian crises. Here, we review the current literature about mobile health outreach programs in family planning. Recent findings Mobile health outreach programs are effective in delivering family planning services by increasing access to family planning services including expanding method choice, contributing to resilient healthcare models, and advancing reproductive justice. Mobile health outreach programs may be a reasonable, cost saving, person-centered alternative to delivering healthcare particularly when traditional systems are strained. Summary Mobile health outreach programs in family planning exist in the United States and globally. Current literature suggests that mobile and outreach programs are effective in increasing knowledge and access to family planning in part by expanding method choice. A mobile health outreach approach is a resilient model that is person-centered and lends itself well to empower patients to practice self-care. The findings and lessons learned may be helpful in guiding future mobile health outreach programs in family planning and other services conducive to an out of clinic model, particularly as a response to overburdened health systems. © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

	abstract = {Youth homelessness remains a major public health issue in the USA, and youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) are still one of the more understudied and underserved groups. Comprehensive sexual and reproductive health (SRH) programs for YEH are rare. Yet, such programs are potentially effective settings through which to link YEH with housing services. Wahine (“woman”) Talk is one such comprehensive program for YEH, and is a multilevel intervention delivered out of a youth drop-in center in Honolulu, Hawai ‘i. One of Wahine Talk’s core components is addressing basic needs, including providing linkages to housing services. Little research exists on SRH programs’ opportunities and challenges to providing linkage to housing for YEH. The current study is an exploratory study asking, “What are opportunities and challenges to linking young women experiencing homelessness to housing services through a comprehensive sexual and reproductive health program?” The study team collected in-depth qualitative data through seven focus groups and 25 individual interviews with Wahine Talk staff and youth participants aged 14–22 years. Multiple team members analyzed the data using template analysis. The analysis revealed that while comprehensive SRH programs may have some opportunities and challenges to linking YEH to housing services that are consistent with traditional housing assistance programs, there are also factors specific to SRH programs. In particular, opportunities would be SRH programs employing a housing staff person and bolstering staff-youth meetings and communication. A challenge specific to SRH programs would be prioritizing youth’s reproductive justice (i.e., choice) in lieu of solely prioritizing pregnancy reductions and delays; thus, it is recommended to train staff to prioritize youth’s reproductive justice. The findings highlight the importance of SRH programs having staff focused on housing, sufficient opportunities for youth and staff to communicate with each other, and staff trained to prioritize youth’s reproductive justice. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {To design family planning policies in Sub-Saharan Africa that are based on reproductive empowerment instead of reproductive control, knowledge on fertility preferences and trade-offs between the number of children and child-raising quality is key. This study is the first to empirically investigate fertility decisions and the quantity–quality trade-off theory from a preferences perspective. For this purpose, we use a novel discrete choice experimental method, including three quality and one quantity aspect of child-raising, and three socio-economic drivers of fertility. The choice experiment was executed with 1000 men and women in rural Senegal and rural Uganda. We show that rural households prefer to have many children, but women and non-poor respondents demonstrate a lower preference for many children than men and poor respondents. We find that the quantity–quality trade-off is a two-sided story. On the one hand, for most of the quality attributes, we confirm the existence of a trade-off. On the other hand, quantity and quality are complementary when all children in the household can attain a lower secondary school diploma. Our results imply that improving living conditions and access to infrastructure in rural areas may empower people to make decisions leading to a lower fertility. Aligning family planning programs with reproductive justice requires a shift in focus from reproductive control, based on mere expansion of contraceptive use, to reproductive empowerment, based on preference-based family planning programs. Improving rural livelihoods in general, and specific targeting of family planning programs to people with low-fertility preferences could be a first step. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

From a reproductive justice framework, we examined psychological outcomes of sterilization approval and denials among a sample of 154 childfree women and nonbinary people AFAB who sought and either obtained or were denied sterilization. Participants completed measures of psychological well-being, self-esteem, and sexual quality of life. Childfree participants who obtained sterilization reported higher self-esteem, better sexual quality, and higher well-being than childfree individuals who were denied the procedure. Neither age nor time since making the sterilization request accounted for the differences between the groups in terms of sexual quality of life and psychological well-being.

	abstract = {Background: Past studies in high-income countries have shown an association between unintended (unwanted or mistimed) pregnancy and child development; no national-level studies in low-and-middle-income countries have been conducted. Moreover, extant studies often adjust for potential mediators, underestimating the average population effect. Methods: We aimed to estimate the effect of unintended pregnancy on early childhood development in Ecuadorian children aged 3 to 5, participating in the National Health and Nutrition Survey 2018. We used a design-based doubly robust estimate. First, we used propensity score matching (1:1) to identify a subsample equally likely to come from a desired vs. unintended pregnancy based on geographic area, household income, paternal intendedness, the mother’s current marital status, age, ethnicity, and educational level, depressive symptoms, and the child’s gender and age. Then, we used a logistic regression model to explore the relation of maternal pregnancy intentions with adequate development, as defined by the Early Childhood Development Index (ECDI). While exempt from review by an Institutional Review Board, this secondary research was conducted in accord with prevailing ethical principles. Results: Among 1694 observations representing 162,285 Ecuadorian children, unintended pregnancy associated with inadequate development (odds ratio: 1.56; 95% confidence interval: 1.06; 2.29), after adjusting for all relevant confounders. Unintended pregnancy was also negatively associated with all four ECDI domains, socio-emotional development being the most affected. Discussion: Our doubly robust design found evidence of the relation between the maternal perception of pregnancy and early child development. Addressing this relation to achieve reproductive justice entails considering a wide spectrum of population health and legal interventions to allow adequate access to education, contraception, and safe abortion. Moreover, pre- and post-natal check-ups could screen for unintended pregnancy and provide support accordingly. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

In the USA, over the last decades - even before Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization overturned the federal right to abortion - various states have sought to restrict abortion access. Often times, this legislation has been advanced based on legislators' personal moral values. At the bedside, in contrast, provision of abortion care should adhere to the normative principles of medical ethics and reproductive justice, centreing patients and their individual reproductive intentions and desires. Abortion regulations, through their influence on patients and providers, may facilitate or impede such ethical care at the bedside. In this paper, we present a framework to model how abortion legislation should fit into the patient-provider relationship and to clarify the dynamics by which legislation may affect healthcare encounters. Our proposed framework serves as a tool to analyse the ethical impact of abortion regulations. We propose a model for assessing abortion policies based not on legislators' or advocates' individual moral claims, but on the shared, normative framework of clinical medical ethics. Through contrasting case studies, we demonstrate how a robust normative ethical framework can recentre patients and their reproductive needs. Our model is one way to account for - and safeguard - patients' diverse viewpoints and needs in the development of abortion policy, and it can serve to ground narratives for advocacy by healthcare workers and their professional organisations.  © 2024 BMJ Publishing Group.

	abstract = {Objectives: Nearly one-third of low-income women of reproductive age in the U.S. receive care in federally qualified community health centers, but comprehensive reproductive care is not consistently provided. Illinois Contraceptive Access Now (ICAN!) is an initiative addressing the access gap to high-quality contraceptive care with a focus on normalizing reproductive health screening for patients in federally qualified community health centers (FQHCs). Study design: This multi-method program evaluation used the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework, with retrospective and prospective data collection from three Illinois FQHCs who participated as Quality Hubs, and from a Community Advisory Board. We conducted descriptive analysis of patient surveys using the Person-Centered Contraceptive Counseling (PCCC) measure (n = 142); clinician and staff pre-and post-training surveys (n = 210); and Community Advisory Board surveys (n = 8) collecting quantitative and qualitative feedback. We ran logistic regression on claims data from 15- to 49-year-old patients identified as female at birth (n = 103,756). Results: Reach assessment showed patients receiving contraceptive or preconception care increased from 1063 per month in 2020 to 1236 per month in 2021 (16% increase), while general volume increased 2%. Effectiveness showed most patients (78%) described the quality of contraceptive counseling as “excellent” on the PCCC. Adoption assessment showed knowledge increases after clinical training on Modern Contraception (85% pre-training, 95% post-training) and Reproductive Justice (RJ) (58% pre-training, 70% post-training). Implementation assessment found that most Community Advisory Board members felt ICAN! was responsive to community needs. Conclusions: The ICAN! demonstration year increased provider knowledge and volume of reproductive care at three Illinois FQHCs. Implications: Contraceptive access initiatives that operationalize same day access to birth control methods while training FQHC providers on RJ and modern contraception, show promise on several measures. Early evidence from ICAN! indicates increased reproductive health service provision, as well as increases in provider knowledge of RJ and modern contraceptive care. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

Lisu, who endured these procedures, struggle with strength loss, nervousness, and pain. Government discourses diminish the Lisu experience, arguing that the policy was lenient toward them. Lisu themselves are reticent to share their experiences but have devised new practices to care for those affected. Drawing on long-term ethnographic fieldwork, I argue that these chronic illnesses and accompanying care practices constitute everyday forms of remembering through which Lisu give shape to their experiences of cultural loss under Chinese colonization while generating new social relationships. This analysis sheds light on Indigenous experiences of birth planning in China with broader implications for understanding the bureaucratic violence of medicine. © 2023 The Authors.

As antiabortionists weaponize adoption to attack reproductive rights, psychologists must recognize adoption as a key reproductive justice issue with significant, lifelong physical and psychological impacts, especially on adopted people and birth parents. Recognizing critical adoption studies as an application of a reproductive justice framework, we argue that psychologists must understand how adoption is both sustained by and reinforces structural inequality and global reproductive injustice. In a post-Roe reality, clinicians and researchers must critically examine adoption histories and myths in order to address the needs of the adoption triad. As an interdisciplinary team of researchers and clinicians in psychology; medicine; genetic counseling; and women's, gender, sexuality, and Asian American studies, we examine adoption's ties to settler colonialism, racism, classism, and imperialism and interrogate harmful dominant narratives about adoption. We then summarize clinical considerations for working with members of the adoption triad, future directions for research on adoption, and recommendations for both clinicians and researchers to advance adoption competence in the face of current attacks on reproductive rights in the United States. © The Author(s) 2023.},

They were also presented as a solution to migrant women's supposed lack of integration into Swedish society. Criticism towards discourses and policies of family planning is extensive, from scholars challenging the notion of 'voluntariness' to those arguing that, in family planning, women's lives are subordinated to economic and developmental goals. While contraceptive technologies hold an impressive emancipatory power in the lives of women globally, vulnerable groups of women have, in the name of family planning, experienced forced sterilisation and reproductive coercion. This chapter aims to analyse political discourses and governmental policies on reproduction through the conceptual lens of reproductive racism. We hope to challenge what we identify as historical amnesia concerning Swedish 'family planning' and show how, in different ways, reproductive rights in Sweden are inscribed and embedded into racial inequalities. The empirical material presented here has been collected with the aim of illustrating governmental policies that historically and today shape and frame diverse forms of reproductive racism with a special focus on welfare professionals. © The Author(s) 2023.

	abstract = {Endometriosis is a common estrogen-dependent disorder wherein uterine lining tissue (endometrium) is found mainly in the pelvis where it causes inflammation, chronic pelvic pain, pain with intercourse and menses, and infertility. Recent evidence also supports a systemic inflammatory component that underlies associated co-morbidities, e.g., migraines and cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases. Genetics and environment contribute significantly to disease risk, and with the explosion of omics technologies, underlying mechanisms of symptoms are increasingly being elucidated, although novel and effective therapeutics for pain and infertility have lagged behind these advances. Moreover, there are stark disparities in diagnosis, access to care, and treatment among persons of color and transgender/nonbinary identity, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, and adolescents, and a disturbing low awareness among health care providers, policymakers, and the lay public about endometriosis, which, if left undiagnosed and under-treated can lead to significant fibrosis, infertility, depression, and markedly diminished quality of life. This review summarizes endometriosis epidemiology, compelling evidence for its pathogenesis, mechanisms underlying its pathophysiology in the age of precision medicine, recent biomarker discovery, novel therapeutic approaches, and issues around reproductive justice for marginalized populations with this disorder spanning the past 100 years. As we enter the next revolution in health care and biomedical research, with rich molecular and clinical datasets, single-cell omics, and population-level data, endometriosis is well positioned to benefit from data-driven research leveraging computational and artificial intelligence approaches integrating data and predicting disease risk, diagnosis, response to medical and surgical therapies, and prognosis for recurrence. © 2023 The Authors.

But not all patients have equal access to reliable information. This Article addresses the urgent downstream harms caused by the lack of access to abortion information, and argues that in view of these consequences, regardless of abortion's legal status, clinicians have a duty to provide their patients with abortion information. We begin by documenting clinicians' hesitation to share abortion information, drawing on our interviews with 25 doctors practicing medicine in a state where abortion is criminalized. Next, we explain why clinicians are duty-bound to provide all-options counseling. We then consider whether such duties shift where abortion is criminalized. After identifying the limited legal risks associated with supplying abortion information, and showing how, by requiring all-options counseling, professional societies might reduce risks to patients and clinicians, we conclude that, regardless of the legal status of abortion, clinicians have a professional responsibility to share basic abortion information - including treatment options and how to access those options.  © 2023 The Author(s).

Based on rich qualitative data offering in-depth analyses from different geographical, political and cultural contexts, the book explores how reproductive justice is understood, contested and given meaning. Chapters further develop the Black feminist concept of reproductive justice in a critical dialogue with postcolonial theory and explore the strength of transnational feminist practices. This book thus offers a fresh approach to the issue of abortion by engaging with contemporary political and cultural processes, and it expands the narrow notions of women's rights, particularly notions of property rights over bodies, towards an analysis of the political economy of social reproduction and how it affects bodies that can be pregnant.

Therefore, we sought to better understand how health service psychologists’ personal and professional experiences influence each other and explore the ways in which we as reproductive beings and advocates sustain ourselves amidst tremendous sociopolitical uncertainty. In order to do so, we employed a feminist collaborative autoethnography approach grounded in critical theory. Attending to intersectional identities that help shape diverse expectations and experiences, two early career psychologists and four trainees uncovered 12 domains: barriers in academia; reproductive (dis)empowerment; relational connection; power(lessness) associated with social locations; internalization of sex-negative messages; the influence of sociopolitical climate; burdens related to reproductive rights; evaluations of reproductive justice efforts; component of professional identity; expectations from family and community; overwhelming and exhausting advocacy; and fears of inadequacy. We conclude with limitations and implications for the continued promotion of advocacy through practice and training within and beyond the field of psychology. © The Author(s) 2023.},

State borders are becoming ever more delocalised and mobile, as state migration regimes move into and circumscribe the everyday and intimate lives and rights of persons deemed not to belong. In a growing number of EU member states, rights to healthcare and housing inter alia are tied to a person's legal-political status. However, little attention has yet been paid to the effects of bordering on organising for and realising reproductive justice. Following the repeal of the 8th Amendment (the abortion ban) in 2018 in Ireland, conversations and contestations are taking place that serve as a compelling starting point to explore the implications of bordering on organising for and realising reproductive justice. In this chapter, I explore the calls made by the migrant and ethnic minority bloc during the March for Choice 2019 in Dublin, which link state borders to reproductive injustice in Ireland. I draw on preliminary fieldwork conducted in Dublin, interviews and informal conversations online, and secondary material, to understand how colonial, raced, sexed and gendered borders are reproduced and, more importantly, contested in the struggle for reproductive rights and justice in Ireland. © The Author(s) 2023.

Drawing on reproductive justice theory, interviews with seven support workers from various disability service providers in New Zealand were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis.

The value of a reproductive justice framework for countering risk-oriented framings in favor of a social justice perspective that expands the notions of individual rights is discussed.

	abstract = {The shift in global health policy from an emphasis on maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) to sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) marks a significant victory for many reasons. For feminists, this addresses concerns over the essentialist and pronatalist biases of the maternal frame, and it emancipates women beyond their socioculturally prescribed roles as mothers. Moreover, the shift to a focus on sexual and reproductive health and rights broadens commitments to health services like abortion access, services to address gender-based violence, and support for LGBTQ youth, and to potential beneficiaries beyond pregnant and parturient women. In this article, however, I argue that while this shift in policy focus represents an overdue discursive victory, there are more complex implications for both policies and the individuals that they affect. I suggest a more deliberate approach to the construction of unified, inclusive, reproductive subjects that can be situated in particular contexts and experiences. I also consider the ways in which a unified reproductive subject can combine the maternal with multiple (racialized, LGBTQ, variably abled) subjectivities in order to create possibilities for points of feminist (standpoint) inquiry, grounded normative analysis, and improved understanding of global reproductive justice that are fundamentally antiessentialist and capable of revealing situated knowledges. © 2023 The University of Chicago.

In the findings, I map Filipino women’s embodied encounters during abortion alongside a complex interplay between digital and physical spaces. Here, I highlight the following processes: 1) accessing the digital abortion marketplace, 2) queering everyday spaces into makeshift abortion places, 3) embodying affinities in the digital abortion community, and 4) claiming collective resistance through abortion testimonies. This study discusses empirical and theoretical insights towards women’s embodied precarities and forms of resistance during abortion and in relation to structural violence.

Accordingly, most social movement research focuses on progressive movements that adopt intersectionality as a guiding framework for organisation and mobilisation, mainly feminist, reproductive justice, LGBTQ and other movements spearheaded by university-educated Millennials. In contrast to most studies, we conduct a qualitative digital ethnography of Las Kellys, a Spanish grassroots movement with no explicit intersectional approach, but located at the intersection of the labour and feminist movements, and consisting of middle-aged, working-class (immigrant) women with no university background who fit their activism into their spare time. Our findings suggest that (1) Las Kellys deploys intersectional practices and disputes despite lacking an explicit intersectional approach, and (2) the development of intersectional practices and disputes in Las Kellys is the result of inter-movement diffusion processes from the anti-austerity protest cycle and the current wave of feminist protest. Moreover, we argue that the case of Las Kellys is part of a larger diffusion of intersectionality across contemporary Spanish activism as an outcome of the anti-austerity and feminist protest cycles. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Focusing on the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) training materials for clinicians, we examine the biopolitics of reproductive counseling for the IUD among this population. Specifically, we interrogate how American clinicians are trained to engage young patients in the coproduction of reproductive biographies to determine their suitability for the IUD. Ostensibly recognizing the importance women’s autonomy to reproductive justice, ACOG stresses the importance of ‘shared decision-making’. However, we argue that ACOG’s approach to shared decision-making still enrolls patients in processes that delineate forms to reproductive differences to be controlled. Specifically, obstetricians and gynecologists are instructed to categorize certain reproductive bodies as risky, differentiating them from those classified as timely and responsible. These categories, underpinned by constructions of normative readiness, reproduce forms of ‘colorblind’ difference under the rubric of reproductive risk. Our findings suggest clinicians are still trained to employ a gynecological gaze that differentiates patient populations based on perceived reproductive responsibility. Thus, we argue that beneath the surface of collaborative reproductive counseling, the gynecological gaze continues to differentiate treatment for those bodies classified as irresponsible. Our analysis highlights the enduring power relations that link the production of reproductive health knowledge and deeply gendered and implicitly racialized systems of categorizing populations. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

In this overview, I survey the main lenses through which various actors have linked climate justice and reproductive justice in the United States. First, I review the literatures: on climate justice, the perspective that those who are least responsible for the conditions causing climate change are disproportionately impacted by it; and on the reproductive justice, which focuses on rejecting reproductive oppression to achieve comprehensive reproductive autonomy for individuals and communities. Next, I analyze frameworks that seek to reframe reproductive justice through a populationist, climate-centered lens. I contrast these framings with new approaches focused on racial health disparities and intergenerational justice. The article ends with questions about the next directions in climate justice and reproductive justice linkages: in particular, the role of eco-anxiety in shaping reproductive futures. In so doing, I argue for approaches that challenge mainstream framings focused on population size and growth, and instead foreground the embodied reproductive outcomes of climate-impacted communities.

In the literature, delayed childbearing is usually discussed in the context of reproductive justice, and in relationship to ethical issues associated with the use and risk of assisted reproductive technologies. We aim to go beyond these more “traditional” ways in which reproductive ethics is framed by revisiting ethics itself through the lens of the figure of the so-called “older” mother. For this purpose, we start by exploring some of the deep seated socio-cultural discourses in the context of procreation: ageism, ableism and the widespread bias towards geneticism and pronatalism. Afterwards, we provide a critical overview of the key arguments against or in support of advanced motherhood. We then briefly discuss how entrenchment by both sides has produced an impasse in the debate on the ethics of advanced motherhood and proceed by arguing that it is fundamental to bring about a change in this narrative. For this purpose, we will revisit the feminist usage of the concept of vulnerability which will allow us both to criticize culturally prescribed norms about motherhood and to address the painful reality of age-related fertility decline. In the last section, we argue that instead of defining “older” motherhood as an ethical problem, we should problematize the fact that female reproductive ageing is an understudied and ill-sourced topic. We believe that allocating resources to research to better understand female reproductive ageing is not only ethically permissible, but might even be ethically desirable. © 2023, The Author(s).},

This chapter engages these three rights together by considering the intersections between environmental and reproductive concerns and activism, through the framework of environmental reproductive justice. In line with this framework, proposed by Mohawk midwife Katsi Cook, it focuses on research in anthropology and related disciplines that considers how environmental degradation, pollution and climate change shape the conditions of possibility for biological, social, and cultural reproduction.

	abstract = {In Kenya, the pregnancy rate of 15% among adolescents aged 15–19 years is alarmingly high. Adolescent girls living in informal urban settlements are exposed to rapid socio-economic transitions and multiple intersecting health risks and may be particularly disadvantaged in accessing sexual reproductive health services. Understanding vulnerabilities and service-seeking behaviours from different perspectives is important in order to support the development and implementation of progressive policies and services that meet adolescents’ unique needs within urban informal settlements. This study explored policy makers, community health service providers’ and community members’ perceptions of access to, and delivery of, sexual reproductive health services for pregnant adolescents in one informal urban settlement in Nairobi. We employed qualitative methods with respondents throughout the health system, purposively sampled by gender and diversity of roles. We conducted focus group discussions with community members (n = 2 female-only; n = 2 male-only), key informant interviews with policy makers (n = 8), traditional birth attendants (n = 12), community health volunteers (CHVs) (n = 11), a nutritionist (n = 1), social workers (n = 2) and clinical officers (n = 2). We analysed the data using thematic analysis. Government policies and strategies on sexual and reproductive health for adolescents exist in Kenya and there are examples of innovative and inclusive practice within facilities. Key factors that support the provision of services to pregnant adolescents include devolved governance, and effective collaboration and partnerships, including with CHVs. However, inadequate financing and medical supplies, human resource shortages and stigmatizing attitudes from health providers and communities, mean that pregnant adolescents from informal urban settlements often miss out on critical services. The provision of quality, youth-friendly reproductive health services for this group requires policies and practice that seek to achieve reproductive justice through centring the needs and realities of pregnant adolescents, acknowledging the complex and intersecting social inequities they face. © 2023 Oxford University Press.

Better known as misoprostol, it was designed as a stomach ulcer drug but is now used around the world as an abortion pill due to the self-experimentation of those in Latin American communities who were seeking ways to end unwanted pregnancies. We develop a chemical geography approach to misoprostol that allows us to scale inward to understand the chemical properties of this medication and also to scale out to understand how medicinal effects are interwoven with and determined by global politics. Misoprostol as a chemical alone does not guarantee a successful abortion and instead “scaffolding” in the form of mobility and information is required to transform misoprostol from a chemical to a safe and effective technology of abortion. First, we examine how misoprostol is moved by feminist networks in Mexico and Peru. Second, we argue that to be useful it is not enough just to access the pills, as information on how to use them is required. These themes culminate in our contribution of pharmacokinetical geographies, the microgeography of the placement of pharmaceuticals in and on a body and its ramifications. The chemical geographies of misoprostol tell a story of power, bodily autonomy, and resistance. © 2023 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Taiwan is the first Asian country to legalise same-sex marriage, yet the law favours heterosexual couples and denies LGBTQ+ reproductive rights. Thus, Taiwanese gay men seek third-party reproduction overseas to become parents. This article exemplifies gay men's unequal conditions from a non-Western perspective. I re-examine scholarly literature on the interlocking concepts of reproductive justice, stratified reproduction, and queer reproduction to answer what reproductive justice gay men need and how their injustice position situates within and beyond the nation-state borders. Drawing on the reproductive justice framework and studies of queer reproduction, this article proposes a transnational perspective to understand queer reproductive justice through the case that elucidates the specific context of Taiwanese gay men. This article aims to make two contributions. Firstly, it reconsiders the reproductive framework from a transnational perspective to argue that gay men's reproductive justice should be conceptualised at the intersection with other dimensions of injustice. Secondly, this article suggests that the transnational approach could be applied as a critical lens for future research in queer reproduction and reproductive justice. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {This article analyses the conceptual histories of words associated with female genital parts to explore how they may affect the lived experience of people with these parts and the quality of gynaecological care they receive. Specifically, we examine the implications of using the word’vagina’ to replace the word’vulva’, or indeed to indicate the entire female genitalia. This article does so through an analysis of existing scholarly work and through text mining methods such as word frequencies, most distinctive word collocates and word-embeddings drawn from literary and women’s magazine corpora. We find that words indicating specific female genital parts are very infrequently mentioned in our corpora, which shows that there is a troubling lack of exposure and education in our socio-cultural context when it comes to the female genital anatomy. When they are mentioned, their usage reflects historical and patriarchal associations that have been primarily attached to the word’vagina’. When it comes to the’vagina’ and’vulva’, the penis is the most prevalent association by far; whereas the most commonly occurring female genital parts are parts to do with reproduction—reinforcing a long-standing and disproportionate emphasis on the female genitalia’s reproductive function. Our research also reveals a concerning emphasis on non-evidence-based female hygiene products, thus perpetuating the damaging stereotype of the dirty vagina. These findings may explain many negative patient outcomes such as stigma attached to seeking out timely gynaecological care, lack of informed medical consent and non-evidence-based practices exacerbated by problematic cultural depictions of the female genitalia. They can also explain the neglect of female sexual agency, pleasure and well-being. Understanding historical and contemporary usages of words for the female genitalia has important implications for the quality of patient care today and is a critical component of gender and reproductive justice. © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group.

Using a postcolonial lens, we highlight some of their shortcomings and paradoxes concerning women's reproductive justice and problematise the absence of discourse focusing on reducing inequalities. At the core of these shortcomings is the limited reflection on or engagement with neoliberalism, neoconservativism and the growing religious fundamentalism, particularly its views on sexual and reproductive rights. While neoliberalism claims to offer women agency to make free choices, its emphasis on individuals as free entrepreneurs holding sole responsibility for their financial situation is a deterrent for most women, because neoliberalism simultaneously undermines the institutions that enable self-sufficiency. In addition, neoconservatism and religious fundamentalism focus on preserving traditional family structures, regarding marriage as a heterosexual institution and the rights of the unborn as central. This is particularly critical for women in the Global South, especially African countries, where the application of the gag rule by Global North funding agencies restricts access to sexual and reproductive rights, including abortion, in the name of protecting the unborn. © The Author(s) 2023.

	abstract = {The battle to protect abortion rights in the United States has not been this fierce in fifty years. From the U.S. Supreme Court's recent Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision to a precipitously growing number of states passing draconian laws that drastically limit - and in some states, entirely ban - access to safe and legal abortion services, reproductive freedom is under siege at every turn. The current assault on reproductive freedom has had devastating consequences for all people, but most acutely for historically marginalized communities, including people with disabilities. Critically, this attack most adversely affects people who live at the intersection of disability and other marginalized identities or statuses. Nonetheless, when disability is invoked in discourse concerning abortion, it is typically done to either support or oppose abortions based on fetal disability diagnoses. By framing disability and abortion only in the context of disabilityselective abortions, activists, scholars, legal professionals, and policymakers fail to recognize that it is actual disabled people - not hypothetical fetuses with disability diagnoses - who are harmed by abortion restrictions. Indeed, disabled people disproportionately experience pervasive and persistent disadvantages that increase their need for abortion services. They also experience considerable structural, legal, and institutional barriers that already put access to safe and legal abortion out of reach for many. In response, the Article proposes a blueprint to help activists, scholars, legal professionals, and policymakers as they imagine the next steps in the battle to protect abortion rights in a way that fully includes people with disabilities. First, the Article situates the current battle to protect abortion rights within the social and institutional contexts that propagate reproductive oppression of people with disabilities by examining how reproduction has been weaponized over time to subjugate disabled people as well as presenting contemporary examples of such injustices. Thereafter, it explores disabled people's unique needs for abortion services and the myriad ways they are disproportionately and adversely affected by restrictions on abortion rights. Next, the Article presents disability reproductive justice, a jurisprudential and legislative framework, and its application to the fight for abortion rights. Finally, drawing from disability reproductive justice, the Article suggests normative and transformative legal and policy solutions for challenging the current assault on abortion rights and its impact on disabled people. © 2023 University of California, Berkeley.

If a serious attempt is to be made to purge medicine of its ongoing role in unequal care, then departments must commit the same intellectual and material resources as they would to the other health challenges in their remit. A division that understands the unique needs and complexities of the specialty, including translating theory into practice, is uniquely positioned to keep health equity as a focus of clinical care, education, research, and community engagement. To achieve reproductive justice, an approach addressing the intersectionality of race, ethnicity and gender identity is critical. In this article, we detailed the ways in which divisions of health equity within departments of obstetrics and gynecology can dismantle impediments to progress and can move our discipline closer to optimal and equitable care for all.

Using a Reproductive Justice framework, which identifies systemic barriers to accessing healthcare services, we examine ageism as a potential factor restricting adolescents’ access to SRHS. While the Reproductive Justice framework has addressed systemic issues like racism and ableism in healthcare, ageism involving adolescents has been less explored. The article challenges the pertinence of mandatory parental consent requirements—as a potential barrier—for adolescents’ access to SRHS. We argue that in the specific context of SRHS (contraceptives, abortion, testing and treatment of sexually transmitted infections), adolescents’ autonomy (self-determination) should be respected if they request to access those services independently. From a global health perspective, adolescents have a low prevalence and uneven access to SRHS. To address the issue, we propose the integration of adolescence into the Reproductive Justice movement to empower them through education on how to access the SRHS they need. © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group.

Wade, there is an urgent, vital need for feminist scholarship that addresses the ways structural stigma and oppressive policy affect diverse groups of women and people assigned female at birth (AFAB). Accordingly, in this introduction to the special issue of Psychology of Women Quarterly, we provide a historical overview and timeline of reproductive rights and (in)justice in the United States in order to illustrate how we have arrived at this perilous moment in history. Reproductive (in)justice exacerbates inequities regarding who has been encouraged to reproduce, who has been denied reproductive autonomy, and who has been required to reproduce and refused the right to parent their children in safe environments. Accordingly, we aver the importance of centering an intersectional and reproductive justice framework in understanding how coalescing forms of oppression (e.g., racism, capitalism, sexism, ableism) circumscribe reproductive autonomy. We begin the special issue with articles that examine how social policy and structural oppression have violated women's and people AFAB reproductive healthcare, followed by articles that examine how such policy and oppression affect women's reproductive decision-making. We conclude this special issue with an article that centers reproductive justice advocacy in the ongoing fight for reproductive rights and bodily autonomy. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Since the US Supreme Court overturned Dobbs v Jackson, expanded access to abortion has been critical. Abortion is safe, and related complications are rare. The safety of abortion provision by advanced practice clinicians (APCs) is well documented. Despite the increase in targeted restrictions for patients and clinicians in many states post-Dobbs, in recent years there have been meaningful gains in recognition and codification of abortion as part of an expanded scope of practice for APCs. Thus, creating a formal written pathway for midwives to obtain privileges in abortion provision could also improve abortion access. In New York City's public health care system, the largest in the United States, midwives provide a significant portion of perinatal and gynecologic care. Yet, until recently, a process to privilege midwives in the provision of abortion services did not exist. In response, midwives and physicians at a large New York City hospital system sought key stakeholder support to develop a pathway for certified nurse-midwives and certified midwives, licensed midwives in New York state, to obtain the necessary training needed for independent abortion provision. This article describes the development of a midwifery-led pilot program to improve abortion access by increasing the availability of trained midwifery abortion providers, along with the results of staff meetings exploring attitudes toward abortion care by APCs. We report our safety statistics from this pilot program and share existing evidence for safety of abortion provision by midwives and other APCs. © 2023 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.},

However, this practice was contested when thousands of foetuses' graves were found, each marked with a cross and displaying the name of the person who had aborted. This chapter aims to analyse the practice of the burial of aborted foetuses as an obstacle to reproductive justice in Italy, in the context of anti-genderism and neo-Catholicism contributing to shaping pro-life stances. Moreover, this study explores three threats to reproductive justice: firstly, the possibility open to health professionals to conscientiously object; secondly, the limited use of medical abortion; and thirdly, the limitations established by the law concerning assisted reproductive services. These threats are employed as a background to understand pro-life actions in this context. Findings suggest that the Catholic Church influences discussions on reproductive rights on several levels, including regarding the burial of aborted foetuses. Despite the relevance of this topic in the current sociopolitical framework, the lack of attention paid to it in academia presents this study with some limitations. For this reason, more research is needed. © The Author(s) 2023. All rights reserved.},

This paper will entice environmental justice scholarship into conversation with geography to stress how embodied geographies of environmental justice are necessary to understand the geographical, gendered, sexualized, and racialized arrangement of environmental injustices. Expanding Environmental Justice to incorporate the body through Segato's understanding of cuerpo-territorio, a concept that blends geography, territory, and the body, we blur the lines between public and private—emphasizing the role of the state and global capitalism in the subjugation of women and people of color. By asking who reproduces, what is reproduced, and where, in environmental justice work, we underscore that environmental matters are reproductive, and the disproportionate embodied consequences of environmental injustices on sexualized, gendered, and racialized bodies. This violence against feminized bodies is explained as the unintended consequences of global capital accumulation, but decolonial, queer, Black, and feminist geographical insights show how these are central for capital accumulation. Attending to the body as an important geopolitical site allows us to articulate mundane, everyday instances of environmental justice and reproductive justice as geopolitically important. I propose that Embodied Geographies of Environmental Justice that center the concept of cuerpo-territorio underscore that the physical territory of both environmental justice and reproductive justice struggles is in racialized and feminized bodies. By bringing in feminist, Marxist, and postcolonial understandings of production and reproduction, I provide a framework that allows for a global and nuanced understanding of gendered geographies of violence, environmental, and reproductive justice. A reading of a Moraga poem toward the end of the paper, demands that we attend to women of color theorizing their own experiences in radical and innovative terms that resist and transform oppressive relations offering possibilities for renewal, regeneration, and healing. © The Author(s) 2023.},

They aim to address the prevalence of early marriages as well as subsequent underage pregnancies and childbirth. Based on in-depth anthropological research, this article argues that apart of humanitarian concern, involvement with Syrians' underage fertility can be understood against the background of reproductive governance. Interviews with Jordanian health care workers reveal a dominant concern with Syrians' culture. By distinguishing different reproductive cultures, boundaries between both national groups are marked. Syrian women's experiences of perinatal healthcare in Jordan point at the importance of reproductive stigma and morality as tools of governance. These findings support the ‘populationism’ thesis, which argues that the international paradigm shift from population control to reproductive rights in postcolonial contexts has been incomplete. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose: In this paper, we discuss the need to move beyond theoretical explorations of social determinants of health (SDoH) to addressing systemic racism and its effect on Black maternal health outcomes. We also address the importance of connecting nursing research, education and practice and offer suggestions on how to transform the teaching, research and clinical practice specific to Black maternal health. Knowledge Development: A critical analysis of current Black maternal health teaching and research practices in nursing informed by the authors' experience in Black/African diasporic maternal health and reproductive justice. Discussion: There is a need for nursing to be more intentional in addressing the effects of systemic racism on Black maternal health outcomes. In particular, there is still a substantial focus on race rather than racism as a risk factor. The focus on racial and cultural differences rather than systems of oppression continues to pathologize racialized groups while failing to address the impact of systemic racism on the health outcomes of Black women. Conclusion: Using a social determinant of health framework to examine maternal health disparities is useful; however, focusing on SDoH without challenging systems of oppression producing these disparities does not produce substantial changes. We suggest adding frameworks grounded in intersectionality, reproductive and racial justice and moving beyond biological assumptions about race that pathologize Black women. We also recommend a deliberate commitment to reshaping nursing research and education to centre anti-racist and anti-colonial practices that value community knowledge and practices.

Taking a new chronological and thematic approach to the study of the US epidemic, it explores five arenas of women's AIDS activism: transmission and recognition, reproductive justice, safer sex campaigns for queer women, the carceral state, and HIV prevention and treatment. In so doing, it moves the historical understanding of women's experiences of AIDS beyond their exclusion from the initial medical response and the role women played as the supporters of gay men. Asking how and on what terms women succeeded in securing state support, In Her Hands argues that women protesting the neglect of their health-care needs always risked encountering punitive intervention on behalf of the symbolic needs of fetuses and children - as well as wider society - deemed to need protecting from them. © 2023 by Emma Day.

Excepting assisted reproductive technologies, there are few other reproductive technologies that have had this long a history and yet continue to have such large biological and sociocultural implications on and beyond the body. In this chapter, the author focuses on the hormonal contraceptive pill as an artefact that has been researched, written about, consumed, rejected, and tinkered with by an extremely diverse set of people for increasingly different reasons. She examines interdisciplinary engagements on contraceptives as a corrective to demographic concerns inspired by Malthusian ideologies. The author then focuses on the debates between reproductive autonomy and reproductive coercion and how these tensions are (un)settled and productively examined in anthropological studies that focus on reproductive justice. Finally, the conclusion centers progressive nonbinary contraceptive futures in light of the environmental crisis. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Published 2024 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

	abstract = {A prototype artificial womb is anticipated to be ready for human trials within five years. This technology departs from previous forms of neonatal care. Rather than treating the complications of premature birth, if successful, it will prevent these complications from arising to begin with by extending the period of gestation and allowing the neonate to continue to develop in an environment analogous to the uterus. Much of the social-scientific literature suggests that artificial wombs will improve health outcomes for pregnant people and neonates in general and may improve or expand reproductive choice in pregnancy. Using a critical lens informed by a reproductive justice framework, I argue that this approach to artificial wombs meets a challenge in (1), the persistence of racialized inequity in health outcomes for pregnant people and neonates and (2) historical and contemporary instances of classed and racialized reproductive coercion. I argue that beyond acting to prevent circumstances in which the artificial womb creates opportunities for coercion or exacerbates existing inequity, we might explore alternative paths for this technology as a tool to benefit all pregnant people by reorienting the discourse toward a focus on justice. I propose an approach to artificial wombs informed by a reproductive justice framework that centralizes those who have been most marginalized within reproductive care at each stage of the technology’s design, development, and implementation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

In this article, we build on understandings of the reproductive justice framework by integrating a postcolonial lens and bring the powerful conceptual tools of postcolonial feminist theory to bear on issues of reproductive oppression in India. We articulate the elements of such a postcolonial lens—the transnational operation of race, Orientalism, the subjective experience of colonialism as well as the role of the nation-state and nationalism in shaping reproductive lives—and demonstrate how these elements, along with religion, caste, and right-wing Hindu fundamentalism, structure reproductive oppression in India. Through our discussion of the issues of sterilization, sex-selective abortion, and commercial surrogacy in India we reveal how the underlying coloniality of Malthusian ideas of controlling population to reduce poverty, Orientalist and racist tropes of moral and intellectual inferiority and sexual licentiousness, and the Orientalist and colonial framing of the “East” as backward, uncivilized, and dependent clearly shape reproductive issues in India. Offering a nuanced analysis of the heterogeneity of reproductive oppression within India, our discussion brings reproductive justice into conversation with a feminist postcolonial perspective to foreground the continued impact of colonialism, neo-colonialism, and settler colonialism on reproductive oppression. © 2023 Feminist Formations.},

In this intervention, we wish to focus on the commonality between RJ's three tenets: the figure of the child and its analytic force. We argue that while the aim of the RJ framework is not to reify fetuses and children at the expense of adults nor to reinforce a pronatalist position, the fact that the tenets are formulated around children means that, when mobilized for political or analytical purposes, they can reinforce repronormative mandates. We use the examples of forced sterilization and abortion in Peru to consider the issues this figuration of the child brings into being and the landscape of meaning it produces. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Background: Individuals with substance use disorders (SUD) have disproportionately high rates of unintended pregnancy. Reducing harm associated with this risk and its biopsychosocial consequences requires evidence-based, non-coercive interventions that ensure access to contraception for individuals who choose to prevent pregnancy. We examined feasibility and impact of SexHealth Mobile, a mobile unit-based intervention that aimed to increase access to patient-centered contraceptive care for individuals in SUD recovery programs. Methods: We conducted a quasi-experimental study (enhanced usual care [EUC] followed by intervention) at three recovery centers with participants (n = 98) at risk for unintended pregnancy. EUC participants were offered printed information on community locations where they could access contraception care. SexHealth Mobile participants were offered same-day, onsite clinical consultation on a medical mobile unit and contraception if desired. The primary outcome was use of contraception (hormonal or intrauterine device) at one-month post-enrollment. Secondary outcomes were at two-weeks and three-months. Confidence in preventing unintended pregnancy, reasons for non-use of contraception at follow-up, and intervention feasibility were also assessed. Results: Participants (median age = 31, range 19–40) enrolled in the intervention period were almost 10 times more likely to be using contraception at one-month (51.5%) versus the those enrolled in the EUC period (5.4%) (unadjusted relative risk [URR] = 9.3 [95%CI: 2.3–37.1]; adjusted relative risk [ARR] = 9.8 [95%CI: 2.4–39.2]). Intervention participants were also more likely to be using contraception at 2-weeks (38.7% vs. 2.6%; URR = 14.3 [95%CI: 2.0–104.1]) and three-months (40.9% vs. 13.9%; URR = 2.9 [95% CI: 1.1–7.4]). EUC participants reported more barriers (cost, time) and less confidence in preventing unintended pregnancies. Mixed-methods feasibility data indicated high acceptability and feasible integration into recovery settings. Conclusions: Mobile contraceptive care based on principles of reproductive justice and harm reduction reduces access barriers, is feasible to implement in SUD recovery settings, and increases contraception use. Expanding interventions like SexHealth Mobile may help reduce harm from unintended pregnancies among individuals in SUD recovery.

	abstract = {For individuals pursuing medically assisted gender transition, gender-affirming surgical treatments, such as oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) and orchiectomy (removal of the testicles), cause sterility, and gender-affirming hormone treatment with medications (i.e., testosterone and estrogen) may negatively impact infertility. The major United States (US) medical associations already endorse fertility preservation (FP) through cryopreservation (i.e., “freezing” egg and sperm) for transgender individuals. Despite these endorsements from the relevant medical societies, medical insurance coverage for FP remains very limited in the US. Given the high out-of-pocket costs for FP services, fertility preservation remains financially out of reach for many transgender individuals who may desire it. We present an ethical justification for universal FP coverage for all transgender and gender diverse (TGD) individuals who request this option during medically assisted gender transition. First, we argue that gender-affirming medical care is analogous to other medical interventions and treatment regimens that compromise fertility, such as cancer care, and that both types of interventions need to be afforded the same medical benefits and assistance in pursuing fertility goals. Second, we argue that the lack of FP for transgender individuals contributes to the ongoing and profound transphobia and anti-trans bias that has been exacerbated in the past several years across the healthcare landscape in the United States. We argue that the provision of FP coverage for transgender individuals is necessary for clinicians and third-party payers to state their unequivocal support for TGD patients and their healthcare needs. © International Network on Feminist Approaches to Bioethics, 2023.},

The Colombian Truth Commission was the first truth-seeking transitional justice body worldwide to directly investigate these forms of conflict-related violence. Based on an ethnographic analysis of the Commission’s work on reproductive violence, in this article I engage with the reproductive justice framework to argue that the Commission’s work broadened understandings of both gendered victimhood and reproductive autonomy. Regarding gendered victimhood, I show that the Commission’s work focused on gaining recognition for conflict-related reproductive violence as distinct from conflict-related sexual violence, identifying conflict-related practices of reproductive violence and offering recommendations for addressing such practices. Secondly, I show that not only was the Commission the first truth-seeking body to directly investigate reproductive violence, but it did so through an understanding of reproductive violence that does not revolve around the notion of autonomy as individual choice. I argue that by doing this, the Commission compelled us to comprehensively consider war as part of the conditions under which reproductive autonomy may be exercised. Following this line, the latter part of the article focuses on the Colombian government’s use of glyphosate as a form of conflict-related reproductive violence that claimed ownership over the reproductive futures of entire communities by creating environmental devastation. © 2023 The Author(s).},

In this article, I use hysterectomy as a case for understanding how reproductive health practices are constrained by and contribute to notions of gender, race, and stratified reproduction. Hysterectomy is regularly performed yet understudied and has been transformed by both technological advances and shifting norms in gender and reproduction. I draw on 100 in-depth interviews with individuals who had, want, or are considering hysterectomy to treat chronic reproductive health conditions or as gender-affirming care for trans and gender-nonbinary (TGNB) individuals. These comparative groups shed insight across three gender groups (cis women, trans men, nonbinary) as well as across race. Findings show divergent patient–provider interactions ranging from physician support to provider coercion to gatekeeping. Similarly, the data reveal that hysterectomy evokes a wide range of reactions—from delight to neutrality to grief. These distinct reactions and interactions map on to gender, race, and ethnicity, revealing persistent reproductive stratification by social positionality. Bringing together feminist science and technology studies with intersectional theories of the body and reproductive justice, I show how stratified reproduction operates when gender identities vary and introduce the concept of opting into infertility. © 2023 by The Author(s).},

The Argentinean feminist movement is internationally well known and publicly recognised for its massive mobilisation for the legalisation of voluntary termination of pregnancy. A central argument in this chapter is that the decision to support the bill proposal for the legalisation of abortion, taken finally, after a failed attempt in 2018, by the Argentinean Senate in December 2020, must be understood as a product of Argentina's long history of women's struggles and of decades of feminist mobilisation. The aim of the chapter is to explore the feminist-inspired struggle for the right to abortion, with particular emphasis on the intergenerational and intersectional feminist labour at the core of the 2020 feminist success. The aim is also to analyse what scholar and queer activist Mabel Bellucci (Historia de una desobediencia. Aborto y feminismo. Capital Intelectual, Buenos Aires, 2014) names a 'history of disobedience': the diverse and contradictory ways through which feminist struggles for abortion rights created powerful alliances and innovative forms of collaboration, developing an understanding of abortion rights within the frame of reproductive justice. © The Author(s) 2023.

	abstract = {Since the early 1990s, global treaties on maternal and reproductive health have obligated governments to ensure quality postabortion care: emergency obstetric care for women experiencing medical complications following abortion. While postabortion care is available in hospitals around the world, little is known about how this global model has been integrated into daily obstetric care in countries with restrictive abortion laws. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in Argentina and Senegal, we explore how health workers have adapted the global postabortion care model in ways that simultaneously challenge and reinforce national prohibitions on abortion. We use the term “subversive epidemiology” to describe how health workers adjudicate between allegedly legitimate and illegitimate cases of pregnancy termination or loss. In Argentina, these practices have expanded access to safe abortion in certain health facilities. In Senegal, these practices have redefined postabortion care as an intervention for the treatment of complications of miscarriage. Although the global postabortion care model aimed to depoliticize the problem of unsafe abortion, we find that health workers’ clinical and record-keeping decisions are decidedly political as they contribute to an epidemiological record that often does more to obscure than elucidate the incidence of abortion. Our research highlights the importance of cross-national microanalyses of health workers’ experiences and practices in understanding how reproductive governance unfolds at the intersection of global and national health policies and proposes applying the reproductive justice framework to abortion politics in the global South. © 2023, The University of Chicago.

Pastors and activists alike turned to the depiction of the apocalypse in popular media to describe the urgency of decisive action. Implicitly, these depictions offer a curious method for engaging and imagining children. Assata Shakur writes compelling poetry in her autobiography about her hopes for the world. In one poem, entitled For My Daughter Kakuya, I argue that Shakur engages in Afrofuturist speculative fiction as she envisions a future world for her daughter. This paper explores how writers living through these times themselves imagine Black children at the end of the world. What would happen if we took seriously the notion that the “end of the world” is always at hand for Black people? This article explores the stomach-turning warning that Jesus offers in Mark 13:14–19 regarding those who are “pregnant and nursing in those days”. Using a reproductive justice lens, this paper explores the eternal challenge of imagining and stewarding a future in which Black children are safe and thriving. It also explores the limits and possibilities of partnering with radical Black faith traditions to this end. © 2023 by the author.},

Lund University, 2019), this chapter revisits and re-examines feminist mobilisations around reproductive rights and justice in Chile. Focusing on performative and discursive strategies used by feminist organisations in the struggle for free abortion, the aim of the chapter is to analyse how such strategies are grounded in epistemologies of embodied resistance to past and present biopolitical and anti-gender regimes. The theoretical framework draws upon a feminist trajectory of (gendered) biopolitics, and embodied performativity and reproductive justice are key concepts in the analysis. The chapter argues that the demands for easy, (legal,) safe and free abortion constitute the frame within which the struggle for free abortion is situated. Subsequently, the struggle situates itself outside of the binary scope of the pro-choice/pro-life dichotomy. The chapter also demonstrates how feminists use a wide range of discursive and embodied performative strategies to centre upon issues such as linguistic androcentrism, sociocultural stigma around abortion, misogyny institutionalised in the healthcare system, compulsory motherhood, economic inequalities and racism. Hence, the struggle for abortion is connected to the struggle to improve the material conditions of women's lives as well as to the struggle for an extensive democratisation of Chilean society. © The Author(s) 2023.

Following the overturn of Roe v. Wade and federal abortion protections in the United States, medication abortion and telemedicine for abortion are increasingly vital. Black, Latinx, and lower-income women in the United States already experience disproportionate barriers to abortion care and interpersonal and structural violence—interconnected, social systems that police bodily autonomy. This current study examined qualitative data from a larger community-led, reproductive justice project on medication abortion perspectives among Black and Latinx women in a large, urban center in Georgia. We used thematic analysis to examine interviews (N = 82) with key informants (n = 20) and interviews (n = 32) and focus groups (n = 30) with Black and Latinx women ages 18–51 years. Four violence-related themes were identified: (a) sexual assault and intimate partner violence as reasons for abortion; (b) reproductive coercion by partners and family members; (c) reproductive coercion by predominantly White providers; and (d) abortion bans, the legacy of enslavement, immigration enforcement, and poverty as structural violence. Shifting family planning care to be patient- and community-centered, in conjunction with policy advocacy to change oppressive systems, is critical. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {In this essay, I draw from reproductive justice theory, arguing for greater analyses of reproductive health histories through an intersectional feminist lens. Decentering US-centric reproductive rights histories and paying special attention to race, class, and gender helps unravel the intricate narrative that tied abortion providers in northern Mexico to a racialist logic of danger, dirt, and death in the years before Roe v. Wade. These logics were deployed by doctors, attorneys, and activists in the United States as justification for the legalization of abortion. By tackling the history of anti-Mexican racism and racialist images of the borderlands region itself, using oral histories as well as patient and doctor testimonials, this article is a counternarrative to the myths about Mexican abortions before 1973. Using feminist, antiracist analysis, this article also adds to abortion travel scholarship, opening new pathways for research about reproductive health-care migrants and providers in the global South. © 2023 The University of Chicago.

They discuss their own political journeys, shared by many activists today, which they describe as involving building and re-envisioning a desired future, as well as the role of Black feminism and abolition. The conversation, introduced by Chantelle Lewis of Surviving Society and Sophia Siddiqui of Race & Class, unpacks the workings of the carceral state and the specific racial and class targeting of surplus Black workers. Drawing from their experience on the practicalities of organising today, they discuss their commitment to internationalism, the challenges of building genuine coalitions and the need to connect the dots between different systems of domination and violence to understand the functioning of the carceral state, and the centrality of reproductive justice and the fight for bodily autonomy. © 2023 Institute of Race Relations.},

	abstract = {A core issue in reproductive justice concerns how racism impacts reproductive health outcomes for Black women. However, the intersectional experiences of middle-class Black women navigating racism in reproductive health systems have not been fully captured in psychological literature. By utilizing a Black feminist approach to qualitative inquiry, this study situates the psychological dynamics behind middle-class Black women's interpretations of and reactions to gendered racism in reproductive settings within the historical context of slavery and its aftermath. The data analysis of 12 interviews captures how middle-class Black women reflect on their interactions with gynecologists, narrate their anticipation of gendered racism, and interpret and respond to experiencing gendered racism. Findings from this study suggest that gendered racism is a haunting of embodied gynecological trauma that maps onto the historical legacy of slavery. This study offers psychology an empirical and analytical framework for moving forward with its conceptualizations of how race, gender, and class intersect in service of reproductive justice. Results from this study can be used by clinicians to guide their clients towards healing gendered-racist-related stress, as well as medical schools to educate obstetricians and gynecologists on how to provide anti-racist care to their Black patients.

Methods: We searched PubMed, CINAHL, SocINDEX, and PsycINFO for research related to reproductive justice written in English and published in the United States from 1980 to 2022. A review of 440 article titles and abstracts yielded 32 articles for full-text review; nine articles met inclusion. Results: Eight addressed Tenet 1; five mentioned Tenet 2; none addressed Tenet 3.

	abstract = {Language is commonly defined as the principal method of human communication made up of words and conveyed by writing, speech, or nonverbal expression. In the context of clinical care, language has power and meaning and reflects priorities, beliefs, values, and culture. Stigmatizing language can communicate unintended meanings that perpetuate socially constructed power dynamics and result in bias. This bias may harm pregnant and birthing people by centering positions of power and privilege and by reflecting cultural priorities in the United States, including judgments of demographic and reproductive health characteristics. This commentary builds on relationship-centered care and reproductive justice frameworks to analyze the role and use of language in pregnancy and birth care in the United States, particularly regarding people with marginalized identities. We describe the use of language in written documentation, verbal communication, and behaviors associated with caring for pregnant people. We also present recommendations for change, including alternative language at the individual, clinician, hospital, health systems, and policy levels. We define birth as the emergence of a new individual from the body of its parent, no matter what intervention or pathology may be involved. Thus, we propose a cultural shift in hospital-based care for birthing people that centers the birthing person and reconceptualizes all births as physiologic events, approached with a spirit of care, partnership, and support. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Period poverty adversely affects the health of anyone capable of menstruating, which is nearly half of the world population, at the physiological, emotional, and psychosocial level. Biases, cultural beliefs, ethical reproductive justice issues, social stigma, and systemic factors contribute to period poverty. Every month, certain menstruators are disproportionately impacted by period poverty and struggle to access basic hygienic necessities. Important stakeholders include not only the individual who experiences menses but also educators and school systems, healthcare professionals, policymakers, public health officials, and researchers. Everyone has a role in addressing period poverty by voting for officials that proactively support legislation, policy, and programs at all levels to effectively advocate for menstrual equity and address barriers contributing to period poverty. This includes policies that increase access to menstrual hygiene products, safe menstrual management methods, and reproductive and women’s health education. Programs globally that focus on capacity building and sustainability strategies can be used as models to reduce period poverty, thereby fostering a sense of empowerment and menstruators’ sense of autonomy, dignity, and equality. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To explore: 1) provider narratives of their contraceptive counseling practices with Latina patients within the context of patient-centered care (PCC); and 2) provider perceptions about the barriers to the provision of patient-centered contraceptive counseling in general and more specifically, with Latina patients in Baltimore, MD. Study Design: We conducted 25 semistructured qualitative interviews with physicians and nurse practitioners from four specialties who provide contraceptive care to Latinas in Baltimore, MD. We analyzed data using directed content analysis. We discuss findings with attention to major constructs of PCC, applying a reproductive justice framework. Results: Providers described a contraceptive counseling approach focused on pregnancy prevention as the primary goal. Most respondents used a tiered-effectiveness approach, even while noting the importance of PCC. Providers noted health system barriers to PCC, including time constraints and insurance status. Provider-reported patient-attributed barriers included low patient education/health literacy, culturally-attributed misconceptions about contraception, and language discordance. Conclusion: Providers described knowledge of and intention to practice PCC but had limited integration of it in their own counseling with Latinas. Responses suggest tension between an expressed desire to provide PCC and paternalistic counseling paradigms that prioritize pregnancy prevention over patient preferences. Inequitable health system barriers also interfere with true implementation of contraceptive PCC. Implications: Translating contraceptive PCC into practice, especially for marginalized communities, is paramount. Training should teach clinicians to recognize systems of structural inequity and discrimination that have informed approaches to counseling but are not reflective of PCC. Institutional policies must address health system barriers that also hamper PCC. © 2022 The Author(s)},

Focusing on the role of psychoanalysts in particular, and psychoanalysis, more generally, in Argentina, I make the case for a psychoanalytic political praxis. This engages a Black feminist commitment to reproductive justice, a more expansive frame for politics that can embrace intersectional aims across a range of policy issues connected to the human right to have or to not have children, in a social and political context that supports the common good and facilitates human and environmental flourishing. In doing so, I highlight psychoanalysis’s somewhat hidden history of political commitment and engagement, particularly in terms of the interpersonal approach. I argue that only a sustained commitment from progressive forces, including among those in psychoanalysis, can forestall the further encroachment of authoritarian, anti-democratic forces operating in the US. © 2023, William Alanson White Institute of Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis & Psychology and the William Alanson White Psychoanalytic Society.},

	abstract = {Reproductive autonomy refers to freely choosing whether or not to have a family, decisions about when to found a family, the spacing of children, and other choices related to reproductive health. The chapter argues that the right of a pregnant person to withdraw consent to continuing an unwanted pregnancy needs to be universally protected for everyone capable of gestation - this is essential for reproductive autonomy and personal autonomy more broadly. Contextualising reproductive autonomy as a right to withdraw consent is a stronger positing than as a privacy right or as a component of the right to health. The research finds that international human rights law focuses on the consequences of the inability to withdraw consent in terms of rights violations, but with respect to extreme cases. This has the consequence of respecting the rule, which is a ban on abortion, subject only to exceptions. To shift to universalising a right to withdraw consent to continuing an unwanted pregnancy requires engaging feminist theory and literature on reproductive justice, reproductive autonomy, and relational autonomy. While cognisant that reproductive choices occur in private, the right to withdraw consent is conceived as a public matter of social justice and equality. To fully protect the right to withdraw consent requires establishing an accessible and resourced health infrastructure through law and policy. True equality is not possible unless this form of consent is protected. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Laurie James-Hawkins and Róisín Ryan-Flood; individual chapters, the contributors.},

Yet, upon reflection, the decision simply reinforced what history has shown: women’s rights and opportunities have always been subject to controls, fluctuations, and specious rationales. Dobbs is one in a long line of legal edicts in the U.S. and elsewhere that either allow or curtail and control female agency, including reproductive agency. The decision’s devastating consequences for U.S. women’s reproductive lives are damaging enough, but they are only part of the story. In addition to its hobbling effects on reproductive rights and justice, the Dobbs decision goes hand in hand with the underlying causes of today’s unparalleled environmental emergency. This article argues, through ecofeminist theory and feminist and Native American climate fiction, that Dobbs is a catalyst for understanding the role of patriarchy—as a particularly insidious form of androcentrism—in the destruction of our planet. Evidence is mounting to support claims made by ecofeminists since the 1970s: patriarchy and resulting masculinist values have been foundational to the extractive and exploitative attitudes and practices regarding marginalized peoples, colonized lands, and racialized entitlements to natural resources that have endangered the earth’s biosystems. © 2023 by the author.},

This protocol aims to propose a model to empower Romani women and girls’ reproductive decisions, inspired by Reproductive Justice—the recognition of women and girls’ ability to make safe and free decisions about their bodies and reproduction. Through Participatory Action Research, 15–20 Romani girls and their families, two Romani platforms, and key agents from a rural and an urban context in Spain will participate. They will (1) contextualize Romani women and girls’ inequities, (2) build partnerships, (3) implement Photovoice and advocate for their gender rights, and (4) assess the initiative’s related changes, using self-evaluation techniques. Qualitative and quantitative indicators will be collected to assess impacts among participants, while tailoring and assuring the quality of the actions. Expected outcomes include the creation and consolidation of new social networks, and the promotion of Romani women and girls’ leadership. For this, Romani organizations must be transformed into empowering settings for their communities, spaces where Romani women and girls assume responsibility of the initiatives, being these tailored to their real needs and interests, and guaranteeing transformative social changes. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Our legal system characterizes the unborn in a multiplicity of conflicting ways-from persons to property, from body parts to medical investments. The law of civil wrongs is instructive. It weighs in when misconduct deprives aspiring parents of the child they had hoped to have, whether the transgression takes place during pregnancy or before it. The torts and remedies that govern these cases are riddled with a confusion that comes from treating prenatal life as anything but coherent. The overturning of Roe v. Wade has cast new light on the neglected doctrine of reproductive loss and deepened a tension about the meaning of prenatal life in both private and public law. This Article undertakes the first study of jury verdicts for mismanaged pregnancies and mishandled embryos. This original empirical analysis reveals wildly erratic outcomes. And it lends insight into the influence of racial and class biases about “wanted” children and “deserving” parents. We introduce a framework with which juries should appraise these losses according to three factors. First is the subjective experience of losing a wanted baby. Second is the objective chance of having that baby if not for misconduct. Third is accompanying traumas, such as delivering a dead baby in a stillbirth. Each factor operates to promote reproductive justice and recover principle in how the law treats prenatal death across the landscape of civil awards and criminal restrictions. © 2023, Dov Fox & Jill Wieber Lens.},

	abstract = {Nearly 50 years after Roe versus Wade, the United States Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs versus Jackson Women’s Health Organization unraveled the constitutional right to abortion, allowing individual states to severely restrict or ban the procedure. In response, leading medical, public health, and community organizations have renewed calls for research to elucidate and address the burgeoning social and medical consequences of new abortion restrictions. Abortion research not only includes studies that establish the safety, quality, and efficacy of evidence-based abortion care protocols, but also encompasses studies on the availability of abortion care, the consequences of being denied an abortion, and the legal and social burdens surrounding abortion. The urgency of these calls for new evidence underscores the importance of ensuring that research in this area is conducted in an ethical and respectful manner, cognizant of the social, political, and structural conditions that shape reproductive health inequities and impact each stage of research—from protocol design to dissemination of findings. Research ethics relates to the moral principles undergirding the design and execution of research projects, and concerns itself with the technicalities of ethical questions related to the research process, such as informed consent, power relations, and confidentiality. Critical insights and reflections from reproductive justice, community engagement, and applied ethics frameworks have bolstered existing research ethics scholarship and discourse by underscoring the importance of meaningful engagement with community stakeholders—bringing attention to overlapping structures of oppression, including racism, sexism, and ways that these structures are perpetuated in the research process.

	abstract = {Abortion bans in the United States often include provisions for abortion in the circumstances of rape or incest experience. Such exceptions have been included in important legislation like the Hyde Amendment, 2003 Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, 2010 Affordable Care Act, and state and federal legislation banning abortion in early gestation. Thus, examination of these laws is critical given the 2022 Supreme Court decision to devolve legal access to the state level. This study examines arguments made by proponents and opponents of rape and incest exceptions within early abortion ban legislation using publicly available video archives from legislative sessions in six Southern states. A narrative analysis was conducted on the legislative debate of rape and incest exceptions during the 2018–2019 legislative sessions. We found three core themes when examining legislative debate: belief in people’s claims underpinned opposition or support for exceptions; opinions about trauma were related to views on exceptions; and exception supporters called for empathy and non-partisanship in consideration of rape and incest. Additionally, support and opposition for the inclusion of rape and incest exceptions in draft law did not follow party lines. This study seeks to deepen understanding of the strategies used by legislators to promote and rebuff rape and incest exceptions in early abortion legislation while providing greater opportunity for tailored reproductive health, rights, and justice advocacy and policy, especially in the context of the US South where abortion access is now extremely restricted. © 2023 The Author(s).

We analyze both the current reproductive justice landscape and predict how this landscape will change following the projected reversal of Roe v. Wade. Our results demonstrate that disparities in the presence of abortion facilities and CPCs manifest in terms of rural/urban classification and race/ethnicity. These disparities will become more pronounced in the post-Roe landscape. Four major findings include: 1.) Following the projected reversal of Roe, the ratio of abortion facilities to CPCs will change from 1:3 to 1:5; 2.) the number of people who live closer to a CPC than an abortion facility will nearly double post-Roe; 3.) people in rural areas live in disproportionate proximity to CPCs, although the number of people in large metropolitan areas living closer to a CPC than an abortion facility will increase nearly four-fold post-Roe; 4.) compared to other racial and ethnic groups, a greater percentage of Native Americans live closer to a CPC than an abortion facility and the share of Black and Hispanic/Latino people who live closer to a CPC than an abortion facility will more than double post-Roe. Ultimately, our results push scholars, advocates, and policy makers to discuss access to reproductive healthcare and reproductive justice in terms of presence of CPCs as much as absence of abortion facilities. © The Author(s) 2022.},

We urge instead for an honest reckoning with the root problem of ecologically unequal exchange (EUE) as the system of global extraction, which enacts environmental harm and reproductive injustice. Finally, we call for an anti-imperialist eco-socialist move towards equal exchange on a world scale to end the flow of undervalued resources from the South and to limit the contaminating activities these enable.

It focuses on attempts by Irish healthcare reformers and activists to implement reproductive justice and improve Irish women’s access to essential healthcare services. Irish activists, it demonstrates, employed a strategy of making women’s narratives and stories the central focus of their movement and engaged with a variety of media outlets, particularly social media, to spread their messages. Feminist digital activism challenged high-tech myth systems to redefine women’s health and reproduction, making them central concerns in Irish society and government. The approach of empowering ordinary women to tell their own stories has resulted in widespread compassion and solidarity. This strategy has personalized reproductive justice and established the Republic of Ireland as a model for future intersectional activist movements. Catching Fire also links Irish developments to American advocacy and global movements and places recent activist campaigns in an essential, yet often overlooked, historical context. By valuing women’s embodied experience, activists reimagined the use of technology, disrupted the nature/culture dualism, and empowered women to tell their stories. © Oxford University Press 2023.},

	abstract = {Objective: To assess patient and provider perspectives on the acceptability of reproductive goals assessment in public mental health clinics and inform potential tailoring for these settings. Data Sources and Study Setting: Primary qualitative data from patients and providers at four clinics in an urban public mental health system serving individuals with chronic mental illness (collected November 2020–October 2021). Study Design: This was an exploratory qualitative study with patients (English-speaking women of reproductive age, primarily Black or Latina) and mental health providers (psychiatrists, psychotherapists, case managers, nurses). We examined the acceptability of reproductive goals assessment within mental health care and obtained feedback on two reproductive goals assessment conversation guides: PATH (Pregnancy Attitudes, Timing, and How Important is Pregnancy Prevention) and OKQ (One Key Question). Data Collection: We conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with 22 patients and 36 providers. We used rapid qualitative analysis to summarize interview transcripts and identified themes using matrix analysis. Principal Findings: Perceptions of reproductive goals assessment were generally positive. Providers said the conversation guides would “open the door” to important discussions, support a better understanding of patients' goals, and facilitate medication counseling and planning. A minority of patients expressed discomfort or ambivalence; several suggested providers ask permission or allow patients to raise the topic. Additional themes included the need for framing to provide context for these personal questions, the need to build rapport before asking them, and the challenge of balancing competing priorities. Many participants found both PATH and OKQ prompts acceptable; some preferred the “conversational” and “open-ended” PATH phrasing. Conclusions: Participants perceived reproductive goals assessment as a promising practice in mental health care with unique functions in this setting. Areas of discomfort highlight the sensitivity of these topics for some women with chronic mental illness and suggest opportunities to tailor language, framing, and provider training to support effective and appropriate implementation. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {In 2022, the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and thus ended the legal protection of access to abortion at the federal level. Using techniques of corpus linguistics paired with critical discourse analysis, this article examines how the word abortion is used in a corpus of newspaper reports covering the decision. The analysis uncovers a staunch position of the right to abortion as an abstracted notion, alongside a simultaneous legitimation of individuals acting on those rights in order to construct them as worthy. In essence, the news media discursively reproduce a hegemonic order that demands adherence to the system, valorises responsible subjects and obscures structural inequities of gender, race and class in the name of freedom of choice. Echoing the call of Black and Indigenous feminist activists, this article argues for a shift in discourse towards one of reproductive justice. En 2022, la Corte Suprema de los EE.UU. revocó el fallo Roe v. Wade y, de esta manera, eliminó la protección legal para el acceso al aborto a nivel nacional. El presente artículo examina el uso de la palabra aborto en un corpus de artículos periodísticos acerca de esa decisión, utilizando técnicas de lingüística de corpus junto con análisis crítico del discurso. El resultado de dicho examen demuestra un férreo apoyo al derecho al aborto como una noción abstracta acompañada por una legitimación simultánea de individuos que ejercen esos derechos para erigirlos como válidos. En definitiva, el discurso mediático reproduce un orden hegemónico que requiere encausarse en el sistema, pone en valor a sujetos responsables y oculta las inequidades estructurales que involucran al género, la raza y las diferencias de clase, todo esto en nombre de la libertad de elección. Este artículo aboga por un cambio discursivo que tiene como meta la justicia reproductiva, haciéndose eco de un pedido proveniente de activistas feministas negras e indígenas. © 2023, equinox publishing.},

	abstract = {Persistent narratives regarding reproductive justice and abortion access have frequently perpetuated false narratives regarding disability and abortion. The sensitive nature of abortions due to the possibilities of fetal abnormalities or disabilities is frequently framed as an issue of able-bodied pregnant women harming disabled people through selective abortion – even by well-meaning disability justice advocates. A long history of poor recordkeeping and failures to meaningfully engage with the disability community has led to popular assumptions regarding prenatal testing for some disabilities that pit disabled people and pregnant people as two oppositional groups – and some antichoice political leaders and commentators have used disability and the specter of women “murdering” their disabled children as a justification for criminalizing pregnancy outcomes and abortion. However, these assumptions erase the experiences of disabled people seeking abortions and reproductive healthcare and erase the fact that pregnancy and childbirth are an inherently disabling conditions and that abortion will be a necessary medical procedure in a world with a far greater social safety net and care infrastructure for disabled people. This chapter provides a framework and analysis for social work students and professionals to challenge how this particular “tyranny of vulnerability” can manifest and prevent access to abortion care. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Shanna Katz Kattari; individual chapters, the contributors.},

	abstract = {In 2016 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that for the first time, US women in their thirties were bearing more children than those in their twenties. Analyzing US vital statistics data from the period 1989–2019, we simulated the effect that the distributional shift to older maternal ages at first birth had on health inequity between Black and White infants. Net of maternal socioeconomic indicators, this shift increased the relative odds that White women gave birth to very-low-birthweight (VLBW) infants by 10 percent, versus 19 percent for Black women, largely accounting for the rise in VLBW and the increase in racial inequity seen in the years analyzed. Reductions in infant mortality over the period were dampened by the maternal age shift, especially among Black babies, exacerbating Black-White inequity. Policy implications for promoting reproductive justice include universal tertiary care access, increasing the supply and distribution of maternity care providers, addressing the holistic needs of mothers throughout pregnancy and postpartum, and expanding family support policies. Conceptually, we recommend centering the realities of pregnancy and parenting from the perspective of the populations at highest risk—centering on the margins—and taking into account their implications for maternal weathering (accelerated deterioration due to disparate impacts of structural racism). © 2023, Project HOPE.

Girls and women are vulnerable to various sexual and reproductive risks, which are exacerbated in conflict contexts and can have both short- and long-term economic implications for them, their families, and their communities. Yet neoliberalism and patriarchal power structures prevent women’s economic well-being from being a priority when postconflict policies are designed. Applying a gender lens to postconflict policies, we illustrate why addressing reproductive justice in postconflict contexts is both a gender justice issue and a macroeconomic imperative, as well as providing concrete policy recommendations, including the imposition of a global arms tax, to fund postconflict SRHJ priorities.

This shift has been striking during times of socio-political change as demonstrated most recently by organizational responses to the reversal of Roe v. Wade, with many companies pledging funding for birthing people seeking abortions. While this type of support is valuable, the singular focus on abortion rights within the reproductive justice context minimizes the scope of its intersectional legacy. The purpose of this paper is to advocate for the organizational application of a comprehensive framework for reproductive justice (CFRJ) guided by intersectional Black Feminist epistemology. We will show that many US organizations have already engaged in reproductive justice by weaving together a mosaic of three socio-political moments (the pathway to marriage equality, restrictive immigration policies and COVID-19), that garnered organizational support and advocacy. These moments reflect the comprehensive nature of reproductive justice as conceived by the Black Feminists who originated the term. These ‘turning points’ demonstrate the organization’s capacity for leadership during times of crisis. The paper concludes with recommendations that explore potential pathways for moving forward in supporting work-family and reproductive justice within organizations. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The lawsuit proposes the decriminalization of abortion induced by the pregnant woman herself or with her consent until the 12th week of gestation. At the hearing convened by the Supreme Court, 50 amicus curiae presentations were held, catalyzing the current arguments raised in the public debate on abortion in Brazil. The content of the public hearing (characters, places, images, audios, texts, and video) is taken as empirical material for this research. Considering the centrality of the defense of life/combating death argument, both in speeches for and against the ADPF, we examine the different frameworks used by political actors on the scene when debating the issue of abortion in terms of a clash between death and life. More than a polysemy, it is a clash that makes explicit hierarchies regarding reproduction and women’s lives. © 2023, Universidade de Sao Paulo. Museu de Zoologia. All rights reserved.},

A conceptual framework for the analysis of anticipatory regimes in reproduction is introduced with a focus on subjectification effects and future images. Second, the importance of pregnancy as a connector between reproduction and parenting is highlighted. These propositions are fleshed out with reference to an ethnography of pregnancy care in Switzerland. The results demonstrate that pregnant women are expected to act as anticipating agents and that foetuses are treated as future children. Future images reveal how prenatal care reproduces gender norms.

	abstract = {Study Objective: The objective of this study was to examine racial/ethnic disparities in contraceptive delivery for adolescent patients within an adolescent medicine subspecialty clinical system before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondarily, we aimed to assess the relationship between race and contraceptive delivery by telehealth. Design: Retrospective cohort study using electronic health record data Setting: Three adolescent medicine subspecialty clinics in a large academic hospital system, including an urban location and 2 suburban locations Participants: Patients assigned female sex at birth prescribed hormonal contraception between January 1st, 2018, and May 31st, 2021. Main Outcome Measures: Method and type of contraceptive prescribed (short-acting, medium-acting, long-acting reversible contraception [LARC]) Results: There were 2453 patients in the study; 47.5% were White, 36.0% were Black, and 8.1% identified as Hispanic. After controlling for insurance and age, Black patients, compared with non-Black patients, had twofold higher odds of receiving LARC compared with a short-acting method across the study period (aOR = 2.0; 95% CI, 1.52-2.62). We identified effect modification with significant interaction between Black race and the pandemic period, with evidence of a higher marginal probability of Black patients receiving LARCs during the pandemic. Additionally, during the pandemic, patients receiving new contraceptive prescriptions via telehealth were less likely to be Black (aOR = 0.63; 95% CI, 0.41-0.94) or publicly insured (aOR = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.38-0.81). Conclusion: Our data show significantly higher prescribing of LARCs to Black adolescents by clinicians, which could suggest differences in physician contraceptive counseling with a bias toward preferentially counseling Black patients toward LARCs. Our data also show that Black and publicly insured patients had decreased utilization of contraceptive care by telehealth during the pandemic. © 2022},

	abstract = {Background Historically, childbearing women from diverse and systematically hard-to-reach populations have been excluded from nursing research. This practice limits the generalizability of findings. Maximizing research strategies to meet the unique needs of these populations must be a priority. Objectives The aim of this study was to provide methodological context for the comprehensive application of reproductive justice strategies to guide research methods and promote engagement of underrepresented childbearing women while decreasing systemic bias. Methods In this article, we use a reproductive justice lens to characterize and define strategies for enhancing ethical and equitable engagement in research involving childbearing women who are often systematically underrepresented using a case study approach. Using a specific case study exemplar, the core tenets of reproductive justice are outlined and affirm the need to advance research strategies that create ethical engagement of diverse populations, transform oppressive social structures, and shift research paradigms so research objectives intentionally highlight the strengths and resiliency inherent to the targeted communities. Results We begin by describing parallels between the tenets of reproductive justice and the ethical principles of research (i.e., respect for persons, beneficence, and justice). We then apply these tenets to conceptualization, implementation (recruitment, data management, and retention), and dissemination of research conducted with childbearing women from diverse backgrounds who are systemically underrepresented. We highlight our successful research strategies from our case study example of women with histories of incarceration. Discussion To date, outcomes from our research indicate the need for multilevel strategies with a focus on respectful, inclusive participant and key community partner engagement; the time investment in local communities to promote equitable collaboration; encouragement of the patient's autonomous right to self-determination; and mitigation of power imbalances. Nurse researchers are well positioned to advance research justice at the intersection of reproductive justice and ethics to fully engage diverse populations in advancing health equity to support the best health outcomes.

	abstract = {In this study I explore discourses of contraception and reproduction, which are drawn upon and reproduced in Swedish official online sources on contraceptive advice, through the theoretical frameworks of biomedicalization and reproductive justice. The analysis yielded three interwoven themes: 1) women in need of contraceptives have to balance discourses of exogenous hormones as both an “unnatural” threat to their bodies and as desirable, effective regulators of the same “naturally unruly” body; 2) in search of a “perfect contraceptive fit”, it is the woman who needs to accommodate to available methods, rather than the other way around; 3) women are made discursively invisible, while simultaneously being constructed as individually responsible for reproduction. Underpinning all these themes is the discourse of rational, responsible choices, of exerting agency by choosing the right contraceptive. In the era of biomedicalization, finding a “contraceptive fit” becomes a moral and gendered health practice demanding thorough self-surveillance. The rational woman, exercising control over her reproduction and body, by planning her pregnancy with safe contraceptives, emerges as the only possible position. Recognizing that women’s and fertile person’s reproductive choices are made amid a societal context, with differing personal resources and experiences, would bring us even closer to reproductive justice. © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {“To celebrate freedom and democracy while forgetting America’s origins in a slavery economy is patriotism à la carte.”2 In the 1850s, a slave woman named Celia was raped by her owner and forced to bear his children. The same situation is playing out in present-day abortion prohibition states thanks to the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health overturning Roe v. Wade. In our country, neither a nineteenth-century enslaved woman nor a present day woman of color in many of the former slave states could seek an abortion. This Article argues that anti-abortion laws in the former slaveholding states perpetuate structures of slavery in the form of state control over the Black female body. By centering Black women, this Article shifts our constitutional and political discourse on reproductive justice in important ways. The rationales that propped up maternal bloodline codes and laws enabling forced reproduction in the 1800s persisted through the Jim Crow period to the present day. States have always exercised control over Black women’s bodies, whether through slavery, abortion bans, medical experimentation, gendered lynching, or forced sterilization and eugenics. Anti-abortion laws are no different. The conversation around reproductive choice has, however, always been overwhelmingly white. If we want to truly eradicate slavery and all its vestiges, we must admit the fact that the current trend in the former slave states of outlawing abortion reproduces structures of slavery. This Article exposes the connection between forced birth and slavery, recognizing that there are constitutional pathways to resist anti-abortion laws and support reproductive justice. © 2023 by Halley Townsend.},

	abstract = {Background: Eugenicists at the beginning of the twentieth century feared that the “unfit” were outbreeding the “fit” and promoted interventions like sterilisation as a solution to the perceived problem. Over 60,000 people were sterilised across the United States, victims of eugenic programs implemented in 32 states. Utah had a particularly aggressive eugenic sterilisation program, hailed by eugenicists for sterilising such a large proportion of its population, and lasting well into the 1970s. The goal of the present study was to determine who, at the demographic level, was targeted by this eugenic practice in Utah, and to also estimate how many survivors of the program might still be alive in 2023. Methods: We used archival records and data abstracted from charts at the Utah State Developmental Center to construct an observational cohort of people sterilised under Utah's coercive, eugenic sterilisation program. We described the demographics of the cohort and presented a life table analysis to estimate the number of survivors still living in 2023. Findings: At least 830 men, women, and children (modal age of 15–19, 53.6% female) were sterilised in Utah institutions under a program that was launched in 1925, peaked in the 1940s, and concluded in the 1970s. The life table analysis predicts approximately 54 survivors (36 women, 18 men), with an average age of 78. Interpretation: Many people sterilised under Utah's eugenics law are likely living today. While some states have taken steps to reckon with their roles in depriving people of their reproductive rights, Utah lacks even an official acknowledgment of this shameful, medical history. Given the advanced age of the potential survivors, time is running out for a reconciliation that can be experienced by those who were most harmed by the practice.

	abstract = {Prior to and since the 2022 Dobbs decision, U.S. state laws have endorsed individuals surveilling and punishing those associated with abortion care. This practice presents an urgent need to understand the characteristics of abortion stigma, particularly the perspectives of individuals with stigmatizing beliefs. To examine the concept and characteristics of abortion stigma, we interviewed 55 individuals about whether they thought there should be consequences for getting an abortion and, if so, what the consequences should be. Adults from three states (Michigan, Kansas, and Arizona) were purposively sampled to include a range of abortion identities and levels of religious engagement. We used reflexive thematic analysis to code and interpret the data. Participants imagined consequences including financial penalties, incarceration, and forced sterilization. Three themes highlighted how abortion was described as violating the law, women's gender roles, and religious doctrine; accordingly, abortion was imagined as deserving of negative consequences, although abortion was legal in all states during data collection. We argue that these imagined consequences relied on carceral logics and interconnected sexist, racist, and classist stereotypes that reflect and reproduce abortion stigma. This study deepens the understanding of abortion stigma from the perspective of the stigmatizer, underscoring the danger of legislation grounded in stigmatizing beliefs.

	abstract = {Background: Unintended pregnancy contributes to a high burden of maternal and fetal morbidity in the United States, and pregnancy intention screening offers a key strategy to improve preconception health and reproductive health equity. The One Key Question© is a pregnancy intention screening tool that asks a single question, “Would you like to become pregnant in the next year?” to all reproductive-age women. This study explored the perspectives of community health workers on using One Key Question in community-based settings. Objectives: This study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators to the use of the One Key Question pregnancy intention screening tool by community health workers who serve reproductive-age women in Salt Lake City, Utah. Design: Using reproductive justice as a guiding conceptual framework, this study employed a qualitative descriptive design. Participants were asked to identify barriers and facilitators to the One Key Question, with open-ended discussion to explore community health workers’ knowledge and perceptions about pregnancy intention screening. Methods: We conducted focus groups with 43 community health workers in Salt Lake City, Utah, from December 2017 through January 2018. Participants were trained on the One Key Question algorithm and asked to identify barriers and facilitators to implementation. All focus groups occurred face-to-face in community settings and used a semi-structured facilitation guide developed by the study Principal Investigator with input from community partners. Results: Pregnancy intention screening is perceived positively by community health workers. Barriers identified include traditional cultural beliefs about modesty and sex, lack of trust in health care providers, and female bias in the One Key Question algorithm. Facilitators include the simplicity of the One Key Question algorithm and the flexibility of One Key Question responses. Conclusion: One Key Question is an effective pregnancy intention screening tool in primary care settings but is limited in its capacity to reach those outside the health system. Community-based pregnancy intention screening offers an alternative avenue for implementation of One Key Question that could address many of these barriers and reduce disparities for underserved populations. © The Author(s) 2023.},

While focus is often placed on individual actions and institutional policies and practices, it is important to recognize the role that culture plays within these systems. Mainstream film is not simply 'mindless’ entertainment but a key part of a global cultural industry that naturalizes and normalizes power structures.

	abstract = {Research has shown that women with insecure immigration statuses in the United Kingdom (UK) are more likely to register later in their pregnancy with National Health Service (NHS) maternity care providers. This late engagement with healthcare services is framed in academic debates as one of the key reasons for poor outcomes for these women and their children during and after birth. Interventions, therefore, have focused on how to remove barriers to accessing maternity care for these women. In this paper, we argue that this approach fails to account for the agency of the women adequately, which needs to be understood in the context of state harms and violence towards women with insecure immigration statuses and, in particular, their reproductive lives. We seek to shift these debates by framing this lack of early engagement with state-provided maternity services as a form of refusal that denotes an active disengagement by bordered women from intersecting structures of harm and oppression that are embedded in the UK’s National Health Service, particularly through the charging regime. We argue that the politics of refusal in this case are embedded in struggles not only for border but also reproductive justice. Drawing on participant observation and data from secondary sources, we illustrate how refusal of early antenatal care opens pathways for bordered women to seek the care-ful conditions they need and want during pregnancy. © 2023 by the author.},

	abstract = {This perspective article situates the 2022 United States (U.S.) Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade (1973) within the broader history of abortion rights activism and legislation in the greater Americas. The U.S. public has stereotyped Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) as socially conservative regarding gender issues and anti-reproductive rights. But twenty-first-century LAC presents a more complicated landscape than this dominant narrative suggests. In the past 15 years, political, legislative, and public health advances and setbacks across the region provide both a blueprint for re-establishing access to safe and legal abortion and a warning on the consequences of the criminalization of abortion for the U.S. Employing a narrative approach that summarizes recent interdisciplinary literature, this perspective traces the history of the expansion of abortion access in the Americas. Mexico (2007, 2023), Uruguay (2012), Argentina (2020), and Colombia (2022) legalized abortion on demand within specific timeframes. These expansions coexist with severe restrictions on abortion in various nations including Haiti (1835), the Dominican Republic (1884, 2009), Honduras (1985, 2021), El Salvador (1997), and Nicaragua (2006), as well as some states in the United States (2022). This perspective finds that legalization occurs when feminist activists eschew U.S.-based feminist rhetoric of individual rights and choice to reframe abortion as a form of gender-based violence within a discourse of health and wellbeing as a human right. According to this perspective, restrictions on access to the procedure constitute a form of violence against women and people capable of bearing children and violate human rights.

	abstract = {This essay analyzes the eighteen occurrences of the word wenche in Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales and argues that the idea of the “wenche” persists today, most notably as implicit justification for the rescinding of the constitutional right to an abortion in the US Supreme Court’s monumental decision Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization (June 2022). It takes a Black feminist approach by situating Chaucer’s wenches in the context of Black women’s history and tracing how the word’s resonances continued their pernicious work of making meaning and shaping material realities long after the Middle Ages. It first gives a careful history of wench’s origins and accretion of meaning from the early to the late Middle Ages, paying particular attention to its relationship with the Latin ancilla. It uses the Wycliffite Bible as a lens to explore the term’s rapidly accruing connotations of youth, servitude, femininity, and transgressive sexuality, and discusses the connections between “wenche” and reproduction in An Alphabet of Tales and Geoffrey the Grammarian’s Promptorium parvulorum before tracing its symbolic freight across the Canterbury Tales and pointing to its underlying role in struggles for reproductive justice in our own time. © 2023 New Chaucer Society.

	abstract = {Drawing on qualitative and quantitative data collected during a 5-year multi-disciplinary European research project, in this article we show how restrictions on access to legal abortion, and particularly gestational age (GA) limits at the end of the first trimester of pregnancy, negatively affect women and pregnant people living in European countries where abortion is legal on request or on broad grounds. First, we examine why most European legislations establish GA limits, and illustrate how abortion is framed in national laws and in the current national and international legal and political debates on abortion rights. We then show, based on research data we collected during our 5-year project and contextualized with existing data and statistics, how these restrictions force thousands of people to travel across borders from European countries where abortion is legal, delaying access to care, and increasing pregnant people's health risks. Finally, we explore, from an anthropological perspective, how pregnant people who travel across borders for abortion care conceptualize abortion access, and the relationship between the right to abortion care and the GA restrictions that limit this right. Our study participants criticize the time restrictions established by the laws in their countries of residence as failing to meet pregnant people's needs, highlight the crucial importance of easy, timely access to abortion care even beyond the first trimester of pregnancy, and suggest a more relational approach to the right to access safe, legal abortion. Abortion travel is also a matter of reproductive justice because access to care depends on specific resources including finances, information, support, citizenship status, and social networks. Our work contributes to scholarly and public debates about reproductive governance and justice, by shifting the locus of attention to GA limits and its impact on women and pregnant people, particularly in geopolotical settings where abortion laws are deemed liberal. © 2023 The Authors},

These barriers are underpinned by cisnormativity, a set of assumptions and beliefs that centres cisgender (non-trans) people’s bodies and experiences as the ŉorm’ in reproductive contexts. Consequently, trans people and their reproductive bodies have been presumed to be incapable, unfit or not worthy of reproducing or becoming parents. Drawing on tenets of reproductive justice, this chapter provides an overview of some of the ways that cisnormativity operates and limits trans people’s reproductive autonomy; namely, through media representations of pregnancy, the state regulation of reproductive bodies and definitions of parenthood, and in the lack of access to gender-inclusive fertility and pregnancy information and care. Trans rights movements’ growing resistance to cisnormativity, and the structural inclusion of gender diversity in reproductive discourses, are necessary to ensure that people of all genders can achieve reproductive autonomy free from coercion or discrimination. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Peter Aggleton, Rob Cover, Carmen H.

	abstract = {This article examines the construction of parenthood, drawing on Brazilian cisgender, heterosexual, and homosexual couples' experiences in using assisted reproduction technologies (ART), particularly the surrogacy. For that purpose, we interviewed: 1) a lesbian woman who had her daughter through her partner's pregnancy, using ART with anonymous donor semen; 2) a gay man who, together with his partner, used a surrogacy service under contract via a specialised offshore agency; 3) a woman who was a surrogate, in Brazil, for her sister-in-law and brother who lived abroad and, from abroad, sent an embryo fertilised for surrogacy; 4) a woman who resorted to her sister-in-law in order to be a mother by surrogacy, with ovules from the woman herself fertilised with semen from her husband; and 5) the sister-in-law mentioned in 4), who acted as surrogate for her brother and his wife. These interviews made it possible to think about the discursive construction of the legitimacy of such parenthoods, as it is produced by access to, and manipulation and circulation of, reproductive technologies and persons. This biomedical management of bodies sets up a material and discursive circuit that, in turn, produces a complex web of personal, normative, legal, professional and market relationships, particularly with a view to construction of a parenthood anchored in a notion of biologically-constituted origin. In this respect, biological, affective and social bonds merge to produce a precise placement of who is the father and/or who is the mother, as well as who are the important others and how they are linked to the child in a broader web of parenthood. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

Despite the urgent threats to abortion access facing feminists worldwide, abortion is largely absent from contemporary SRT. This absence is first addressed from a theoretical perspective through the development of three arguments: that SRT can connect abortion to the biological reproduction of labor power via gestational labor, that abortion can make gestational labor less alienating, and that abortion can function as a refusal of productivism and reproductive sexuality. The article then applies these arguments to a preexisting case study of reproductive justice and women in Canada's Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program. By situating abortion within migrant workers' struggles over social reproduction processes, this analysis demonstrates that SRT is useful for the study of abortion and can generate insights different from those of the reproductive justice approach alone. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {This collection aims to fill in the deep gaps of vital contributions that have been erased from the sexuality field, illuminating the historical and current work, strategies, solutions, and thoughts from sexologists that have been excluded until now. Historically, the US sexuality field has not included the experiences and wisdom of racialized sexologists, educators, therapists, or professionals. Instead, sexuality professionals have been trained using a color-free narrative that does an injustice by excluding their work as well as failing to offer a fuller examination of how they have expanded the field and held it accountable. The result of this wholesale erasure is that today many sexuality professionals understand these contributions as extra or tangential, and not part of the full vision and history of the field of sexology. Highlighting the voices and experiences of those who have been racialized and thus excluded, isolated, erased, and yet have still emerged as vital contributors to the North American sexuality field, this text offers a significant shift in the way we learn and understand sexuality, one that is expansive and committed to liberation, healing, equity, and justice. Divided into three sections addressing safety, movement, and oral narratives, the contributors offer insightful and provoking chapters that discuss reproductive justice, LGBTQ themes, racial and social justice, and gender, and disability justice, demonstrating how these sexologists have been leaders, past and present, in change and progression. This futuristic textbook includes correction, engaged reading, and lesson plans which offers community workers and trainers an opportunity to use the text in their non-traditional learning environments. Creating a path forward that many believed was impossible, this accessible book is for all who work in and around sexuality. It welcomes inquiry and celebrates our humanity for the worlds we are building now and for the future. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Bianca I.

	abstract = {This article focuses on access to early medical abortion care under Section 12 of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018, in Ireland and identifies existing barriers resulting from gaps in current policy design. The article draws primarily on qualitative interviews with 24 service users, 20 primary healthcare providers in the community and 27 key informants, including from grassroots groups that work with women from different migrant communities, to examine service users’ experiences accessing early medical abortions on request up to 12 weeks gestation. The interviews were part of a wider mixed-methods study from 2020-2021 examining the barriers and facilitators to the implementation of abortion policy in Ireland. Our findings highlight care seekers’ experiences with the GP-led service provision, including delays, facing non-providers, the mandatory three-day waiting period, and oversubscribed women’s health and family planning clinics. Our findings also highlight the compounding challenges for migrants and additional barriers posed by the geographical distribution of the service and the 12-week gestational limit. Finally, it focuses on the remaining challenges for racialised and other marginalised groups. In order to provide a “thick description” of women’s lives and the complexity of their experiences with abortion services in Ireland, we also present two narrative vignettes of service users, and their experiences with delays and navigating the healthcare system as migrants. To this effect, this article applies a reproductive justice framework to the results to highlight the compounding effects of these barriers on people located along multiple axes of social inequality. © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {This book unpacks and interrogates dominant constructions of mothering, making use of interdisciplinary, ideological and theoretical perspectives to investigate how new rhetorics of mothering can expand the realm of maternal care-givers beyond the biological definitions of motherhood. This diverse collection is at the cutting-edge of rhetoric, feminism, and motherhood studies, and the chapters challenge the confines of biological parenting as heteronormative within the neo-liberal nuclear family. The contributors examine, how despite the diversity of parental relationships, many are excluded by the understanding of mothers biologically tied to their children. The volume seeks to expose the underpinnings of biological primacy and argues that 21st-century families and familial circumstances are ill-served by biological ideology. Topics include Re-Imagining Queer Black Motherhood, Chicana Feminist approaches to reproductive justice, the commercialization and medicalization of infertility, and ableism and motherhood. This is a unique and fascinating book suitable for students and scholars in gender studies, sexuality studies, communication studies, sociology, and cultural studies. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Valerie Renegar and Kirsti Cole; individual chapters, the contributors.

	abstract = {Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic presented new care delivery obstacles in the form of scheduling procedures and safe presentation to in-person visits. Contraception provision is an indispensable component of postpartum care that was not immune to these challenges. Given the barriers to care during the initial months of the pandemic, we sought to examine how postpartum contraception, sterilization, and visit attendance were affected during this period. Study Design. We performed a retrospective chart review to examine contraception initiation, sterilization, and postpartum virtual and in-person visit attendance rates during the first six months (March 15 to September 7, 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the rates in the same period in the year prior at a single tertiary academic care center. We abstracted data from the first prenatal visit through twelve weeks postpartum. Results: With the initiation of virtual appointments, postpartum visit attendance significantly increased (94.6 % vs 88.4 %, p < 0.001) during the pandemic with no difference in overall contraception uptake (51 % vs 54.1 %, p = 0.2) or sterilization (11.0 % vs 11.5 %, p = 0.88). During the pandemic, contraception prescribed differed significantly with a trend towards patient-administered methods including pills, patches, and rings (21 % vs 16 %, p = 0.02). In both periods, there was a significantly younger mean age (p < 0.001), higher proportion of non-White and non-Asian race (p < 0.001), public insurance (p = 0.003, 0.004), and an established contraceptive plan prenatally (p < 0.001) in the group that received contraception. Conclusion: As virtual postpartum visits were instituted, contraception initiation and sterilization were maintained at pre-pandemic rates and visit attendance rose despite the obstacles to care presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Provision of virtual postpartum visits may be a driver to maintain contraception and sterilization rates at a time, such as early in the COVID-19 pandemic, when patient care is at risk to be disrupted by social distancing, isolation, and avoidance of medical campuses. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

This article builds upon prior rhetorical scholarship on infertility by applying an embodied rhetorics framework to capture the resilience infertile persons exhibit when faced with barriers to build their family. To do this, I share a series of texts self-identified infertile advocates produced as they reflected on their encounters with barriers to accessing care and building their families. As a disease that requires self-disclosure as a form of advocacy, I analyze the visual and written texts produced through an embodied rhetorics framework. These texts are forms of public advocacy in that they make visible the multiple embodied misconceptions infertile persons navigate when trying to build one’s family. I discuss these texts as illustrating “misconception fatigue” which is affective toll that accumulates when advocating for one’s reproductive right to have a family. I conclude by encouraging other rhetorical scholars committed to reproductive justice to adopt an embodied rhetorics framework to their scholarship and develop participatory research projects to support the advocacy needs of marginalized reproductive health communities. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

The results reveal a high prevalence of both pressure to get (26 percent of current users) and keep (11 percent of ever users) LARC overall and among young (<25 years) mothers in particular. In addition, pressure to keep LARC is more common among economically disadvantaged, unmarried, and Hispanic women. These findings reveal that in the context of “LARC first” and enduring stratified reproduction, LARC pressure is common, particularly among groups that have long been targets of reproductive disciplining. © The Author(s) 2023.},

The contemporary fiction of Brit Bennett’s The Mothers and Tayari Jones’s An American Marriage, as well as Black feminist work on Assisted Reproductive Technologies, reconsider the difficult ways that race and ‘choice’ have been in tension with each other in political and medical discourse around reproductive rights. Feminist choice debates have been intentionally reframed away from ‘rights’ and toward 'justice’ as an attempt to account for the hyper-control of Black reproduction across a modern history that includes enslavement, mass incarceration, and myths of hyper-reproduction. Complex narrative accounts of thwarted or uncertain Black reproduction built from the embodied experiences of blackness can consider both choice and justice without romanticising motherhood or autonomy. This article troubles the weight on black feminism to conceive and carry children–symbolic and material–into and through precarious life chances into secure (political) futures. Through thick descriptions of the reproductive that run through desire, uncertainty, debt, and vulnerability, black feminist thought and expressive culture can displace autonomy as the underpinning and endgame of feminist reproductive politics. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Since the theories of Thomas Robert Malthus,the debate on population control has been predominantly dictated by male perspectives. With ecological concerns becoming more pronounced in the British public consciousness over the 2010s, onstage representations of population control as apotential solution to climate crisis increased in volume. However, the most popular examples of these plays were, again, mostlyfrom cis male-identifying creatives. Seeking to redress the genderedbias on British theatre's depiction of population arguments, this chapter uses feminist scholarship to analyse three productions by female writers and directors that deal with concerns of populationism and reproductive justice. The first of these is Maud Dromgoole's 3 Billion Seconds (2018). The production is explored through the concept of demopopulationism, which dictates that some parts of a nation's demography should be coerced, dissuaded, or forcibly prevented from reproduction. 3 Billion Seconds is argued to demonstrate that such taxonomic-informed logic leads to acynical dehumanisation of others. The second case study is Florence Keith-Roach's Eggs (2015). Using the framework of reproductive justice-which highlights whether individuals have the free right to choose whether to have children or not, and if their decisions are supported and respected-the analysis is centred on how the two female protag-onists of Eggs do not receive full reproductive justice in the neoliberal society of 2010s Britain. The final section explores Vivienne Franzmann's Bodies (2017) and reflects on the three plays' use of form: particularly, their usesof "fluid realism" and satire to depict populationism, with Bodies showing the assumed superiority of citizens in the Global North through its narrative of surrogacy. The conclusion then underlines how these plays warn against the masculinised biases of neoliberal and populationist ideologies. © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {As we emerge into a post-Roe landscape spurred by state-level “heartbeat bills,” the stakes are high for rhetorical scholars to identify rhetorical topoi that have the capacity to intervene in legislative acts of reproductive injustice. Already, feminist rhetorical scholars have determined the rhetorical limits of topoi derived from legal, medical, and <choice> frameworks. Thus, I build upon Kelly Pender’s “rhetoric of care” to theorize what I name reproductive justice rhetorics of care, rhetorical topoi that can advance reproductive justice (RJ). Importantly, I view RJ as a contingent telos – not an analytic–to which both radical (protest) and reform (institutional) rhetoric can contribute. I argue that Georgia state Senator Jen Jordan’s dissent of HB 481, Georgia’s heartbeat bill, offers three RJ rhetorics of care from within the constraints of institutional dissent: women as the fiduciaries of life, reproduction as an embodied process, and mother – reclaimed and reframed. This analysis underscores the importance of identifying the rhetorical strategies invoked by state legislators to challenge reproductive injustice, given that abortion access will now be controlled by states post-Dobbs. Further, my analytical approach to finding topoi that move toward a contingent telos has implications for additional justice-oriented movements. © 2023 National Communication Association.},

Drawing on a critical genealogical analysis, the article first traces the concept of "bodily autonomy"in feminist mobilizations against sexual and ethnoracial violence from the 1980s to the first decade of the 2000s. It then focuses on the slogan of the 2012 abortion rightsmobilizations, "My body,my decision!,"which relies on bodily autonomy as the central trope of claim making. The article argues that the slogan is limited, not because it draws on a liberal, individualistic framework but because it represents the bodily autonomy of the white reproductive subject, assuming that it is an ethnoracially unmarked, universal subject. In doing so, the article demonstrates how feminist strategies that build on bodily autonomy obscure the state's stratified reproductive policies, which have historically promoted a Turkish majority at the expense of non- Turkish lives.  © 2023 by the Association for Middle East Women's Studies.},

	abstract = {This study investigated maternal mortality solutions mentioned on Twitter by maternal health advocacy organizations in the United States. Using qualitative content analysis, we examined tweets from 20 advocacy organizations and found that the majority of the tweets focused on policy, healthcare, community, and individual solutions. The most tweeted policy solutions include tweets advocating signing birth equity, paid family leave, Medicaid expansion, and reproductive justice bills, whereas the most tweeted community solutions were funding community organizations, hiring community doulas, and building community health centers. The most tweeted individual solutions were storytelling, self-advocacy, and self-care. These findings provide insights into the perspectives and priorities of advocacy organizations working to address maternal mortality in the United States and can inform future efforts to combat this critical public health issue. © 2023 by the authors.},

Calderone tirelessly encouraged parents to be open and honest with their children about the goodness of healthy sexuality. Calderone and SIECUS were subjected to vitriolic attacks by ultra-right-wing religious and political groups beginning in the late 1960s. She is today, however, remembered by supporters of sexual and reproductive justice and comprehensive sex education for her courageous beliefs in the right to experience sexual pleasure, to receive scientifically accurate, age-appropriate sex education, and to the need to teach young people how to make responsible sexual decisions. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Peter Aggleton, Rob Cover, Carmen H.

	abstract = {Federal Indian policy is rooted in family regulation. Here, family regulation is twofold, comprising: (1) the idea that American Indian families should be curated to be more like their non-Indian counterparts; and (2) the child welfare system, as Dorothy Roberts notes. Overall, family regulation was part of an Indian assimilation project. Since the late nineteenth century, assimilationist tactics encouraged the wholesale removal of Indian children, first to boarding schools, and later to adoptive placements. After decades of abusive family regulation practices, Congress enacted the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 ("ICWA") to prevent the breakup of Indian families and promote tribal sovereignty. This Article argues that, in addition to the expressed congressional goal of protecting Indian families, ICWA is a tool of reproductive justice. Beyond the right to abortion, reproductive justice includes the right to have a child, the right to not have a child, and the right to raise a child in a safe and healthy environment. By implementing procedural guidelines to protect Indian family decision-making and child-rearing from state agencies that were, and are, often too eager to promote the settler colonial project, ICWA is a positive disruption of the settler colonial project that defends the reproductive autonomy of American Indian people. As a symbol of the disruption of both historic and contemporary efforts to regulate Indian families through a colonial project that defined families through assimilation, and regulated those it could not, ICWA remains a good policy. Yet, ICWA is under attack like other reproductive rights and the rights of Indian tribes as sovereigns. As such, this Article provides a framework for reproductive rights and explains where ICWA-and more specifically, the needs of American Indians-fit into this framework. Because ICWA does not exist without other attacks on the reproductive autonomy of American Indians and tribal sovereignty, this Article examines the attendant history of the settler colonial project leading up to ICWA, as well as ICWA's goals and mandate, along with what it means to discuss ICWA as a tool of reproductive justice. While opponents frame their attacks on ICWA as a need to "save" Indian children and place them with the "best" families possible, the attacks on ICWA symbolize the ongoing attempts to regulate Indians by eroding their reproductive rights and autonomy. © 2023 Boston University Law Review.

	abstract = {Objective: To examine challenges accessing contraception in the past year and their association with interest in using an over the counter (OTC) oral contraceptive pill (OCP) among Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) in the United States. Study Design: From May 2021 to March 2022, a collaborative research team conducted a cross-sectional online survey using convenience sampling to recruit people who identify as Asian American, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander, Black or African American, Indigenous, or Latina/Latinx and used or wanted to use a contraceptive method in the past year. Respondents were recruited through reproductive justice and community-based organizations. Results: Among 727 respondents, 45% reported experiencing at least one challenge accessing contraception in the past year of which 37% reported a logistical challenge, and 20% reported an interpersonal challenge. Sixty-seven percent of respondents said they were likely to use an OTC OCP. Respondents who reported experiencing at least one challenge accessing contraception in the past year were more likely to say they would use an OTC OCP. Fifty-seven percent of respondents who were not using a contraceptive method in the past year reported they were likely to use an OTC OCP. Conclusion: Among people in this study, interest in an OTC OCP is high, particularly among those who have faced challenges accessing contraception, and among those who are not currently using a contraceptive method. Implications: Availability of an OCP OTC has the potential to address challenges accessing contraceptive care among BIPOC in the United States, who are often impacted by structural inequities and racism. Findings from this study can inform future OTC implementation strategies to ensure OTC access addresses logistical and interpersonal challenges. © 2023 The Author(s)},

At the same time, this article neglects the utopian potential that critics and reviewers have attributed to the text, and instead reveals how such a reading not only ignores substantial aspects of the novel’s ideological complexity, but also unmasks a reader’s complicity with (hetero-)normative understandings of reproduction. © 2023 The Author(s).},

Data Sources and Study Setting: Primary data were collected via a national online survey among people of color in the United States interested in pursuing midwifery education and careers between February 22 and May 2, 2021. Study Design: Cross-sectional survey consisted of 76 questions (75 closed-ended and 1 open-ended questions) including personal, familial, community, and societal motivators and barriers to pursuing midwifery. Data Collection/Extraction Methods: We recruited respondents 18 years and older who identified as persons of color by posting the survey link on midwifery, childbirth, and reproductive justice listservs, social media platforms, and through emails to relevant midwifery and doula networks. We conducted descriptive and bivariate analyses by demographic characteristics and used exemplar quotes from the open-ended question to illustrate findings from the descriptive data. Principal Findings: The strongest motivating factors for the 799 respondents were providing racially concordant care for community members (87.7 percent), reducing racial disparities in health (67.2 percent), and personal experiences related to midwifery care (55.4 percent) and health care more broadly (54.6 percent). Main barriers to entering midwifery were direct (58.2 percent) and related (27.5 to 52.8 percent) costs of midwifery education, and lack of racial concordance in midwifery education and the midwifery profession (31.5 percent) that may contribute to racially motivated exclusion of people of color. Financial and educational barriers were strongest among those with lower levels of income or education. Conclusions: Structural and interpersonal racisms are both motivators and barriers for aspiring midwives of color. Expanding and diversifying the perinatal workforce by addressing the financial and educational barriers of aspiring midwives of color, such as providing funding and culturally-competent midwifery education, creating a robust pipeline, and opening more midwifery schools, is a matter of urgency to address the maternal health crisis. © 2022 The Authors.

Most countries that allow a right to abortion also permit selective abortion on grounds of foetal disablement. In the United Kingdom (UK), s.1(1)(d) of the Abortion Act 1967 allows for the termination of pregnancies where the foetus is likely to be disabled. Section 1(1)(d) was challenged in R. (Crowter) v Secretary of State for Health and Social Care as being in violation of the ECHR. The challenges were dismissed. This article discusses some of the issues relating to s.1(1)(d) and DSA to question some of the explicit and implicit assumptions involved in its justification. A general right to abortion is important, but DSA does have an impact on disabled people in violation of rights under the ECHR that needs to be acknowledged and addressed. The article concludes with a discussion of changes that need to be made in law and society to ensure greater reproductive justice. © 2023 Thomson Reuters and Contributors.},

	abstract = {We report on a comparative situational analysis of comprehensive abortion care (CAC) in Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho and Namibia. We conducted systematic literature searches and country consultations and used a reparative health justice approach (with four dimensions) for the analysis. The following findings pertain to all four countries, except where indicated. Individual material dimension: pervasive gender-based violence (GBV); unmet need for contraception (15−17%); high HIV prevalence; poor abortion access for rape survivors; fees for sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services (Eswatini). Collective material dimension: no clear national budgeting for SRH; over-reliance on donor funding (Eswatini; Lesotho); no national CAC guidelines or guidance on legal abortion access; poor data collection and management systems; shortage and inequitable distribution of staff; few facilities providing abortion care. Individual symbolic dimension: gender norms justify GBV; stigma attached to both abortion and unwed or early pregnancies. Collective symbolic dimension: policy commitments to reducing unsafe abortion and to post-abortion care, but not to increasing access to legal abortion; inadequate research; contradictions in abortion legislation (Botswana); inadequate staff training in CAC. Political will to ensure CAC within the country’s legislation is required. Reparative health justice comparisons provide a powerful tool for foregrounding necessary policy and practice change. © 2023 The Author(s).

Our analysis also makes visible the ways in which the Court’s decision has enacted epistemic violence to decades of reproductive justice-based theorizing and organizing spearheaded by women of color. Applying a reproductive justice (RJ) framework to the Council for Social Work Education (CSWE) Competencies, we identify areas within micro-, mezzo-, and macro-level practice for social workers to disrupt patterns of reproductive oppression, including restrictions on abortion. We believe that every social worker is situated to play a unique role in creating liberatory clinical social work practices. By centering reproductive justice and decolonial thinking in social work education and practice, we can begin to ask different questions and try new strategies to build safe and more supportive environments. © 2023 Taylor & Francis.},

J Psychiatr Res 104:100-107, 2018; Bagadia et al. Int J Soc Psychiatry 66:792-798, 2020). In these situations, prenatal and behavioral health providers have little legally viable guidance on what medical and/or psychiatric care the patient desires (Aneja and Arora Indian J Med Ethics V:133-139, 2020). We created a “Reproductive Psychiatric Advance Directive (PAD),” grounded in Reproductive Justice principles, that promotes patient autonomy by proactively articulating perinatal medical and psychiatric care preferences. We conducted a medical and legal literature review using two sets of terms related to (1) PADs and (2) reproductive health. We convened an expert working group of legal, medical, psychiatric, peer, and advocacy leaders and community-based organizations to develop a Reproductive PAD. Our literature review yielded no results about Reproductive PADs. We created de novo a Reproductive PAD template with sections on medical and psychiatric history, informed consent for critical medical and psychiatric care, family planning and custody preferences, and optional sections on abortion and on electroconvulsive therapy. The Reproductive PAD provides a possible legal mechanism for people of childbearing age with SMI diagnoses to articulate their medical and psychiatric care choices around reproduction and pregnancy. Future research should evaluate the Reproductive PAD as an effective tool for protecting patient autonomy during pregnancy and postpartum and guiding medical and psychiatric providers. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Objective (Study Question): To use systems thinking with diverse system actors to (a) characterize current problems at the intersection of chronic conditions (CCs) and reproductive health (RH) care and their determinants, (b) determine necessary system actors for change, and (c) document cross-system actions that can improve identified problems in the United States. Data Sources/Study Setting: Data were collected from six groups of system actors via online focus groups. Study Design: This is a qualitative multilevel study using the iceberg systems thinking framework. Data Collection/Extraction Methods: Data were collected by note-taking and recording six focus groups; analysis incorporated perspective triangulation using the systems thinking iceberg and system mapping to visualize interconnected system challenges, actors, and action ideas. Principal Findings: Participants described eight necessary system actors: health care institutions, medical leaders, medical providers, patient advocates and foundations, patients and families, payors, policy makers, and research funders. Forty pain points were identified, spread across each of the four levels of the systems thinking iceberg: undesirable outcomes (6), concerning trends (9), system structure flaws (15), and problematic mental models (10). In response to these pain points, a set of 46 action ideas was generated by participants and mapped into nine action themes: (1) adjust QI metrics, incentives, and reimbursement, (2) bolster RH medical education and training, (3) break down medical silos, (4) enrich patient education, (5) expand the health care team, (6) improve holistic health care, (7) modify research and programmatic funding to prioritize RH and CC, (8) spur innovation for patient visits, and (9) support professional champions and leaders. Conclusions: By embracing system complexity, creating visual maps, and pushing participants to identify actionable strategies for improvement, this study generates a set of specific actions that can be used to address pain points across the multiple system levels that make improving reproductive care for people with CCs so challenging. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Purpose: Reproductive rights represent an intrinsic and pivotal human entitlement, encompassing legal protection for procreation. Essential to this framework is the recognition that single women equally deserve reproductive rights. Although Chinese legislation refrains from overtly disallowing reproductive rights for single women, the interplay of conventional marriage norms and family planning policies has inadvertently tied these rights to marital status, consequently constraining single women’s ability to assert them. The establishment of a robust legal structure to ensure reproductive rights for single women would profoundly contribute to advancing a harmonious evolution of China’s population dynamics. Patients and Methods: We employ meticulous textual scrutiny to analyze comprehensively the stipulations concerning women’s reproductive liberties within the framework of Chinese jurisprudence. Furthermore, we engage in empirical inquiry to enumerate and elucidate the multifarious constraints placed upon the reproductive freedoms of unmarried women in the Chinese context. This endeavor entails a detailed exposition and incisive examination of China’s limitations imposed upon the reproductive rights of single women, encompassing both legal strictures and policy dimensions. Results: The absence of legal endorsement and safeguarding has given rise to substantial impediments to the exercise of reproductive rights among single women in China. Not only do endeavors to assert reproductive rights on behalf of single women encounter intricate challenges in judicial implementation, but they also encounter manifold barriers within national policies. This predicament not only subjects single women to considerable psychological strain but also contradicts the overarching objective of achieving a harmonized population development trajectory in China. Conclusion: China should expedite the development of a legal framework for protecting reproductive rights that includes provisions for supporting single women to have children. This legal apparatus should efficaciously enshrine and shield the reproductive rights of single women, thus playing a pivotal role in advancing a more equitable and well-balanced trajectory of population development. © 2023 Li et al.

	abstract = {Preconception health has always been about preventative health care, ensuring the overall wellbeing of people of reproductive age before they have children. However, just as public health and health care have shifted to prioritize equity and include ideas about how social determinants of health influence health outcomes, the field of preconception health has experienced a similar transition. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the evolution of preconception health in the United States after 2005, highlighting the key tensions that have shaped the field. We provide an overview of the early history of the movement and describe how four phases of ideological tensions overtime have led to changes across seven categories of preconception health: definitions and frameworks, surveillance and measurement, messaging and education, strategic convenings and collaborations, clinical practice, and reproductive life planning. We also describe the historic and emerging challenges that affect preconception care, including limited sustained investment and ongoing threats to reproductive health. The vision of preconception health care we outline has been created by a diversity of voices calling for wellness, equity, and reproductive justice to be the foundation to all preconception health work. This requires a focus on preconception health education that prioritizes bodily autonomy, not just pregnancy intentions; national surveillance and data measures that center equity; attention to mental health and overall well-being; and the inclusion of transgender and non-binary people of reproductive age. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The routinization of non-invasive prenatal genetic testing (NIPT) raises urgent questions about women’s reproductive autonomy and disability rights. Many supporters defend NIPT on the grounds that prenatal genetic information helps would-be parents make better family planning choices. We challenge that assessment by showing how, under the current regime of ableism and neoliberal reprogenetics, NIPT provides opportunities for intensified control over women’s reproductive decisions. Focusing intently on the case of Down syndrome, the book demonstrates how several factors ensnare prospective mothers in a web of tough choices by stacking the deck against the decision to bring a child with a genetic impairment into the world and parent her with dignity, including: (1) widespread ableist attitudes in medical institutions; (2) neoliberal welfare policies that privatize social services and the provision of care; and (3) oppressive social norms, including ableist and sexist attitudes. Drawing on feminist political theory and critical disabilities scholarship, we advance a conception of relational autonomy premised on perfectionist liberal notions of the state as a vehicle for intersectional social justice. Our goal is to theorize about which political arrangements would better enable prospective mothers to decide more autonomously whether they want to undergo prenatal testing, terminate a pregnancy following a positive result, carry the fetus to term, raise a child with a disability, or choose adoption. Ultimately, our analysis suggests that genuine reproductive autonomy requires both governmental restraint and active governmental support, arguing that restraint and action can work hand in hand to promote reproductive justice and disability rights. © Amber Knight and Joshua Miller 2023.},

We aim to illustrate that food insecurity infringes upon on all three of these rights and so is a pressing issue for reproductive justice and for sexual and reproductive health more broadly. Methods: Using a phenomenological approach, we outline potential pathways between food insecurity and reproductive justice. Results: There are numerous potential pathways between food insecurity and reproductive justice, including entry into sexual relationships for material support, links to sexually transmitted infections and infertility, structural violence, prioritization and spending tradeoffs between food and other basic necessities, biological impacts of malnutrition, restricted reproductive choices, population control measures, and social stigma and exclusion. Marginalized people are disproportionately impacted by food insecurity and its consequences, with implications for sexual health and pleasure and for reproductive justice. Conclusions:Meaningful and equitable collaboration between people with lived experience of food insecurity, human rights and reproductive justice activists, and academics is critical to sensitively contextualize this work and mobilize broader social change. © 2023 The Author(s).

Moreover, macro-level factors (e.g., poverty, discrimination, community violence, legislative policies) may impede the reproductive autonomy of entire communities. This study investigates a form of violence we term perceived contraceptive pressure in Appalachia, an understudied region of the Eastern U.S., regarding reproductive health and decision-making. Through targeted Meta advertising, participants (N = 632) residing in Appalachian zip codes completed an online survey on reproductive health. The focus of this study was to investigate the prevalence of perceived contraceptive pressure, who was at increased risk of experiencing pressure, and the source(s) of perceived pressure. Binomial regressions were conducted on three different dependent variables: perceived pressure to be sterilized, perceived pressure to use birth control, and perceived pressure not to use birth control. Approximately half of all respondents (49.5%) reported experiencing at least one type of pressure targeting contraceptive decision-making. The most prevalent source of perceived pressure to use birth control was from the healthcare provider (67.4%), and the most prevalent source of perceived pressure not to use birth control was the respondent’s partner (51.1%). Recommendations for providers serving clients in the Appalachian region include pursuing education regarding contraceptive pressure at the individual level and macro-level. In addition, Appalachian residents may benefit from educational programming on reproductive autonomy, healthy relationships, and how to navigate pressure in relationships. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Psychology of Women Quarterly (PWQ) is a leading outlet for feminist psychology research. To elucidate the interrelations of PWQ publications over time, we conducted a citation network analysis of its 2,747 articles and 4,517 citation links. Of the 16 citation clusters that emerged, many echoed key elements of PWQ's scope. These included Cluster 1: feminist consciousness and sexism; Cluster 2: body image and objectification; Cluster 3: feminist psychology, epistemology, and methodology; Cluster 4: gender and educational and occupational experiences; Cluster 5: rape and sexual assault; Cluster 6: power and violence in close relationships; Cluster 7: sexual harassment and workplace discrimination; and Cluster 8: women and power with attention to race and nation. Areas of citation disconnection revealed avenues for resisting citation silos and advancing pantheoretical feminist frameworks on the continuum of patriarchal violence. Small and discontinued clusters were areas ripe for feminist revisiting (e.g., reproductive justice). PWQ articles were cited in an increasing number and breadth of journals over time. These findings can inform authors, reviewers, and editors to advance the next decades of scholarship in PWQ in ways that resist citation silos, revive research on critical domains of women's lives, and foster the feminist edge of our scholarship. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {South Africa has an abortion law which codifies the broad themes of reproductive rights set out in the Constitution of South Africa, other laws and national guidelines. Certain wording of the conditions in the Choice Act for abortion after 20 weeks' gestation, are open to interpretation, being ‘severe malformation of the fetus’ and ‘risk of injury to the fetus’. From 24 weeks onwards, abortion is carried out by feticide/induced fetal cardiac asystole (‘IFCA’) and subsequent induction of labour in South Africa. Some maternal-fetal units have developed guidelines to assist clinicians and patients in decision-making around eligibility for abortion after 20 weeks' gestation, given the broad terms in the law. We consider the guideline used by an institution in the Western Cape for abortion after 23 weeks and 6 days gestation, in terms of its alignment with the law on reproductive rights and its compliance with fair and transparent procedures. We also note its effect on respect for patients and on staff professionalism. © 2023 The Authors. Developing World Bioethics published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

This article reviews the intersection of the Disability Justice Movement and the history of discrimination in the United States against people with disabilities with a particular focus on reproductive oppression. We discuss the mechanisms of inequity and barriers to health care, including financial barriers, inaccessible medical facilities, provider discrimination and competency, and guardianship; as well as the importance of open access to contraception, menstrual health, and abortion for people with disabilities.

Policy reinterpretations and expectations of failure however, are not coming solely from critical and alternative groups in the society. They are first and foremost political, which raises the question how does the moral economy and epistemology of just futures unfold? What are the effects of political exploitation and contamination? Our answer is to review political risks of emancipatory activism in abortion debates, which manifest high levels of polarization and contestation in relation to reproductive justice and human rights. We map out various hazards, showing how they produce what we term post-failure, and sustain emancipation fantasies and alternative policy futures that are linked with oppression effects. With this exploration we see that addressing ignorance and social injustice in policymaking has never been more essential, yet also unpredictable and convoluted in the political risks that it poses.

In this paper we analyse documents from court cases in the Pacific Islands regarding the illegal procurement of abortion. We undertook inductive thematic analysis of documents from eighteen illegal abortion court cases from Pacific Island countries. Using the lens of reproductive justice, we discuss the methods of abortion, the reported context of these abortions, and the ways in which these women and abortion were constructed in judges' summing up, judgements, or sentencing. Our analysis of these cases reveals layers of sexual and reproductive oppression experienced by these women that are related to colonialism, women's socioeconomic disadvantage, gendered violence, limited reproductive control, and the punitive consequences related to not performing gender appropriately. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {The narrative concerning third-world women has long been considered regressive, discriminatory, and monistic. The legal narratives, too, could not escape the traditional trope of identity ascribed to women. Though essentially empowering, the practical realisation of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act of 1971 could never harness a sense of inclusivity until the amendment of 2021. But the seven categories of women included in the amended Act did not consider the issues of pregnancy arising out of a consensual sexual encounter (contraceptive failure) for an unmarried woman. For the first time, the Supreme Court of India has recognised the concept of agency for all women without any external factor functioning as an influence. The idea of choice has never been celebrated. Thus, in the context of contemporary India, where the idea of the metanarrative of identity appears imminent and the third-world postmodern feminism celebrates the ideals of intersectionality, the legal discourse of deconstructing the difference among women in the name of marital status to strip them of their fundamental rights to bodily autonomy and reproductive justice needs intervention. This review paper intends to diachronically approach the existing data of empirical and critical research on abortion vis-à-vis the human rights discourse in the context of Indian women. © 2023 Tripathi.

We recruited participants through social media and two adoption-related organizations. We audio-recorded and transcribed interviews.

Setting: Telephone interviews Participants: Adults ages 18-35 years old who placed children for adoption before they were 20 years old Interventions: Semi-structured telephone interviews Main Outcome Measures: Qualitative data Results: We conducted interviews with 18 individuals (median age of 32 years; range 21-35 years). The median age at pregnancy was 18 years (range 13-19 years). Seventeen participants identified as female and one as nonbinary. Themes included the following: (1) Negative experiences with counseling included limited empowerment to make choices about pregnancy or adoption options; (2) negative experiences with counseling included limited information about practical or financial support for pregnant adolescents; (3) negative experiences with the health care system included insensitivity or lack of awareness of the adoption plan at delivery; (4) positive experiences with counseling included comprehensive unbiased options counseling and adoption counseling emphasizing birth parent choice in openness and family placement; (5) positive experiences included longitudinal emotional support during pregnancy, particularly in ways that normalized adoption placement; and (6) participants desired therapy and/or psychological support following adoption placement. Conclusions: Individuals who chose adoption after adolescent pregnancy described positive and negative encounters with health care and adoption professionals that could serve as targets to improve the overall care experience for this population. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Authors identifying as lesbian mothers wrote submissions to a range of public inquiries, crafting detailed self-representations and often telling intimate stories of everyday experience of discrimination and marginalisation. This article understands the submissions as constrained by the practices of political subjectivity. They are governed by the rules of the authority to which submissions are addressed, even as they make claims for change. Investigation of available submissions from lesbian mothers from nine inquiries points to the classed and raced limits of the normative political subject which emerges and to the presence of historically dominant discourses of the good mother and the narrowed imagination of the marriage equality movement. Diversity in the submissions, however, also challenges the boundaries of the rules and avoids universal conformity to respectability. This analysis contributes to the scant historiography of lesbian mother politics in Australia and to the international literature on queer politics and sexual citizenship. It cautions against simple liberal readings of progress based in the achievement of rights and recognition for newly normative political subjects. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Indigenous women experience extensive reproductive health disparities and reproductive oppression. Theoretical frameworks for understanding the complex intersection of factors that contribute to these experiences are needed, especially those that highlight the resilience of Indigenous peoples throughout settler colonialism. The purpose of this article is to explore the empirical development of the Framework of Integrated Reproductive and Sexual Health Theories (FIRSHT) to contextualize and understand the reproductive and sexual health experiences of Indigenous women. Methods: The FIRSHT was developed through a qualitative descriptive research study with 31 Indigenous women from a Gulf Coast tribe. Interviews were conducted in 2018 and 2019. The first author partnered with a community-advisory board throughout the research project, and in the dissemination of results to tribal members. Results: After presenting a snapshot of the overarching results, we discuss how the FIRSHT incorporates key components of the reproductive justice, resilience, Indigenous critical theory, life course and eco-systemic theoretical frameworks. The proposed framework conceptualizes the interrelationship of factors that impact women’s reproductive and sexual health experiences. Discussion: This research fills a gap in the need for holistic understandings of Indigenous women’s reproductive and sexual healthcare required for the development of interventions that not only address social justice issues and weaknesses in the healthcare system but also promote the existing strengths and resources in Indigenous communities. Policy Implications: This theoretical framework may be useful for researchers interested in studying the reproductive and sexual health experiences of Indigenous women, who desire a holistic and strengths-based framework. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The ever-expanding availability of reproductive technologies, the continued roll-out of ‘family planning’ and maternity services across low- and middle-income settings and the rapid development of the fertility industry mean that it is more likely than ever that individuals, especially women and gender non-conforming people, will engage with more than one RT at some point in their life. These multiple engagements with RTs will affect users’ expectations and uptake, as well as the technologies’ availability, commercial success, ethical status and social meanings. We argue that an integrated approach to the study of RTs and their users not only makes for better research, but also more politically conscious research, which questions some of the ideological precepts that have led to reproduction being parcelled out into biomedical specialisations and a disproportionate focus on particular forms of reproduction in particular disciplines within public health and social science research. We offer this article as part of a wider movement in the study of reproduction and reproductive technologies, which takes inspiration from the reproductive justice framework to address forms of exclusion, discrimination and stratification that are perpetuated in the development and application of reproductive technologies and the ways in which they are studied and theorised. © 2021, The Author(s).},

The pursuit of justice is often related to efforts to attain personal as well as collective well-being. In this paper, we illustrate three exemplars of community psychologists' efforts to promote justice. Within each case study, we discuss the social and community context and examine how the researchers built partnerships and solidarity, developed ways of doing, and approached challenges and solutions. First, we present an example to promote economic justice through an entrepreneurship initiative developed in collaboration with young Black youth with disabilities in the United States. The second case illustrates an effort to promote reproductive justice in collaboration with Roma women and girls in Spain. The third exemplar depicts the use of life stories as a method to raise the voices of displaced, marginalized indigenous women in Peru. Based on these three case studies, we present a synthesis model of social justice. We also discuss implications for future studies emphasizing the importance of engaging community participants in research meaningful ways, developing sustainable partnerships, and decolonizing research. © 2022 Society for Community Research and Action.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) is encouraged as a strategy to address racial disparities in birth outcomes. Black woman-led organizations and stakeholders recommend a thoughtful integration of Reproductive Justice for any LARC programs. This paper will describe how one state-funded maternal and child health program reconceptualized an evidence-based strategy (EBS) focused on increasing access to LARC, to a broader strategy that incorporated principles of Reproductive Justice to improve birth outcomes. Description:: In 2016, North Carolina established the Improving Community Outcomes for Maternal and Child Health (ICO4MCH) program. As part of this program, five county health departments were awarded funding to “increase access to LARC”. Noting community partners’ concerns with this strategy, ICO4MCH leadership revised the strategy to focus on using the Reproductive Justice framework to improve utilization of reproductive life planning and access to LARC. Leaders modified the strategy by changing performance measures and scope of work/deliverables required by grantees. Assessment: Using quarterly reports and focus group data from ICO4MCH grantees, we identified key steps communities have taken to prioritize Reproductive Justice. Key findings include that sites hosted Reproductive Justice trainings for team members and changed language describing family planning services. These activities were tailored to fit community context and existing perceptions about reproductive health services. Conclusion: The ICO4MCH program was able to modify a LARC EBS to better emphasize Reproductive Justice. Local agencies desiring to shift their LARC programs should include and value feedback from those with lived experience and partner with organizations committed to Reproductive Justice. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Reproductive justice is increasingly being utilized as a framework for exploring women’s reproductive health experiences. However, this topic has not yet been explored among Indigenous state-recognized tribes who do not utilize the Indian Health Service, and little research explores what other factors impact women's ability to reach their reproductive goals. A qualitative descriptive research methodology was used to explore experiences of reproductive justice among members of an Indigenous state-recognized tribe in the Gulf Coast. Data were collected through qualitative semi-structured life-history interviews with female tribal members. Several key themes emerged illustrating barriers related to women achieving their reproductive desires. These included: (a) High Prevalence of Hysterectomy or Sterilization; (b) Experiences with Infertility Common; and (c) High Frequency of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome or Endometriosis. Findings of this study reveal that Indigenous women face multiple barriers to achieving reproductive justice. This study is unique in exploring the family planning desires and goals, and the barriers experienced in achieving these reproductive desires, for women in a Gulf Coast, non-federally recognized Indigenous tribe. These results contextualize national trends and suggest that Indigenous women in this study experience reproductive injustices that harm their ability to achieve their reproductive desires. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Background: Black women in the United States disproportionately suffer adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes compared to White women. Economic adversity and implicit bias during clinical encounters may lead to physiological responses that place Black women at higher risk for adverse birth outcomes. The novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) further exacerbated this risk, as safety protocols increased social isolation in clinical settings, thereby limiting opportunities to advocate for unbiased care. Twitter, 1 of the most popular social networking sites, has been used to study a variety of issues of public interest, including health care. This study considers whether posts on Twitter accurately reflect public discourse during the COVID-19 pandemic and are being used in infodemiology studies by public health experts. Objective: This study aims to assess the feasibility of Twitter for identifying public discourse related to social determinants of health and advocacy that influence maternal health among Black women across the United States and to examine trends in sentiment between 2019 and 2020 in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Tweets were collected from March 1 to July 13, 2020, from 21 organizations and influencers and from 4 hashtags that focused on Black maternal health. Additionally, tweets from the same organizations and hashtags were collected from the year prior, from March 1 to July 13, 2019. Twint, a Python programming library, was used for data collection and analysis. We gathered the text of approximately 17,000 tweets, as well as all publicly available metadata. Topic modeling and k-means clustering were used to analyze the tweets. Results: A variety of trends were observed when comparing the 2020 data set to the 2019 data set from the same period. The percentages listed for each topic are probabilities of that topic occurring in our corpus. In our topic models, tweets on reproductive justice, maternal mortality crises, and patient care increased by 67.46% in 2020 versus 2019. Topics on community, advocacy, and health equity increased by over 30% in 2020 versus 2019. In contrast, tweet topics that decreased in 2020 versus 2019 were as follows: tweets on Medicaid and medical coverage decreased by 27.73%, and discussions about creating space for Black women decreased by just under 30%. Conclusions: The results indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic may have spurred an increased focus on advocating for improved reproductive health and maternal health outcomes among Black women in the United States. Further analyses are needed to capture a longer time frame that encompasses more of the pandemic, as well as more diverse voices to confirm the robustness of the findings. We also concluded that Twitter is an effective source for providing a snapshot of relevant topics to guide Black maternal health advocacy efforts.  © Diana Grigsby-Toussaint, Ashley Champagne, Justin Uhr, Elizabeth Silva, Madeline Noh, Adam Bradley, Patrick Rashleigh.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Abortion is a polarizing social and medical issue, even among physicians. Though the public may expect physicians to hold purely scientific attitudes about abortion, their attitudes and behaviors are just as strongly informed by social and political factors as the public’s. In a recent survey study of physicians at an academic medical center about their abortion attitudes, most reported strong support for abortion access. However, more were unwilling to consult in abortion-related cases, and many perceived little or no professional connection to abortion and were reticent to publicly advocate for their position. Methods: In order to investigate the nuances in physicians’ abortion attitudes, we analyzed the open-ended, qualitative responses provided by physicians at the end of a quantitative survey using modified concept mapping procedures and theme generation. Results: Two hundred twenty-two open-ended responses resulted in 487 data units. We cat-egorized respondents’ comments into 2 main groups: attempts to depersonalize or distance oneself from abortion and expressions of nuance or ambivalence about abortion. Ambivalence and nuance in abortion attitudes centered around multiple factors that varied from individual to structural. Conclusions: Our findings support previous literature suggesting that physicians’ abortion attitudes are not binary and add that nuanced attitudes may be perceived as unwelcome. Acknowledging ambivalence and addressing physicians’ tendency to depersonalize abortion could result in more honest, open, and nuanced discourse and contribute to addressing structural issues that result in poor health outcomes, achieving broader reproductive justice goals and greater access to abortion services. © 2022 Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System and The Medical College of Wisconsin, Inc.},

Women are routinely presented with counseling on breastfeeding and contraception throughout their prenatal and postpartum care, but little is published on patients’ own priorities, desires and experiences of this peripartum counseling. This article aims to address this gap in the literature. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients in the immediate postpartum period. The interview guide explored: 1) timing and content of contraceptive counseling; 2) breastfeeding goals and expectations; 3) reasons for contraceptive choices; and 4) recommendations for counseling. Interview transcripts were coded to identify themes and analyzed. Results: Twenty interviews were conducted. The participants were reflective of our patient population in the Bronx, with ninety percent using Medicaid for insurance and fifteen percent concerned about food security in the past month, well-validated questions reflective of poverty and socioeconomic status. Three themes emerged from the interviews: (1) using contraception was described as a selfish decision by the mother without benefit to the newborn; (2) women felt pressure to breastfeed and saw the inability to breastfeed as a personal failure; and (3) medical providers were viewed as more trustworthy when it came to information regarding breastfeeding as opposed to contraceptive options, where decisions relied on anecdotes from friends or family. Conclusions: Most decision-making regarding breastfeeding and contraception relied on the personal experiences of the participants and their friends and family. A clear need for support for women who are unable to breastfeed and education about the benefits of contraception for the newborn was identified. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Transgender people face numerous obstacles to accessing adequate, affordable, and appropriate sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services as outlined by the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 3.7 target of achieving universal access to SRH services by 2030. However, transgender SRH sits as a poorly researched area within public health that makes it difficult to understand the current dilemmas facing transgender SRH. This article reports the findings of a study aimed at taking stock of global research in transgender SRH. Methods: A bibliometric analysis, used to gain insights from the retrieved literature’s metadata, alongside a content analysis were utilized to examine the growth, impact, and content of retrieved articles. Results: Nine hundred fourteen journal articles were retrieved, predominately in English (884; 96.7%). These involved 3653 authors from 46 affiliated countries. Most frequent keywords included HIV, PrEP, and gender identity; corresponding to the SRH issues studied, namely HIV/AIDs and gender reassignment. Top cited and overall articles originated heavily from US affiliated authors. Content analysis outlined the articles’ inclusion of the transgender community to largely have a mixed focus with cisgender people in research, these articles largely disease-focused and conducted within cities in the United States. Conclusions: Growth in transgender SRH research was minimal until the early-2010s, after which a steep rise can be observed. Research retrieved has a disproportionate clinical and biomedical focus around HIV and related STI issues suggesting a failure to engage with reproductive justice and more comprehensive rights-based understanding of SRH. The sustained use of derogative language suggests a need for greater inclusion and awareness of trans identities within research and publishing. The dominance of the United States in authorship and as a site of research establishes the need for more geographically diverse research, trans, and LMIC-led research enquiry and creating greater opportunities for cross-cultural, comparative, and collaborative scholarly work. © 2021 The Author(s).

	abstract = {In 2021, U.S. states enacted 106 different abortion restrictions, the highest number of any year since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973. Inspiring the most public outcry is Texas's S.B. 8, which bans abortion after six weeks and allows private citizens to sue those performing abortions or aiding in this process. Abortion justice supporters should be enraged—but only in small part due to Texas’ ban, any of the other 105 enacted restrictions, or the likelihood that the Supreme Court soon will hand down a decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. We should be enraged because the anti-abortion movement has chipped away at the accessibility of abortion to the degree that the legal right to abortion means far less than it should. Key to this chipping away has been crisis pregnancy centers—religiously motivated, anti-abortion non-profit organizations that critics describe as “fake women's health clinics.” Today, there are 2500 crisis pregnancy centers and just 738 abortion clinics in the U.S., numbers that were reversed 30 years ago. And yet, countering crisis pregnancy centers has been less central to the work of abortion justice advocates than advancing crisis pregnancy centers has been to the anti-abortion movement. In this article, I argue that focusing on crisis pregnancy centers can provide new opportunities for both understanding the contemporary abortion landscape and also for advancing abortion justice activism. To put a finer point on it, I argue that centering crisis pregnancy centers in our development of what Sydney Calkin terms “the political geography of abortion” is one way to animate outrage among those who have not been involved in abortion justice work previously and to sustain outrage among feminist activists who have been worn down by decades of anti-abortion advancement. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: One in three women experience sexual violence during their lifetime; however, little is known about this phenomenon with respect to justice-involved Latina mothers. Using the reproductive justice framework as a theoretical lens, we examined sexual violence in Latina mothers who had experienced incarceration and were thus involved in the justice system. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of a qualitative data set. The reproductive justice framework provided a theoretical lens for examining the women's rights to bodily autonomy, to have or not have children, and to live in safe, sustainable environments given the intersection of incarceration and sexual violence. RESULTS: Women (N = 12) recounted their experiences of sexual violence after having been incarcerated. Incarceration and resulting sexual violence led to discrimination, limited bodily autonomy, sexual exploitation, substance use, depression, anxiety, re-traumatization, recidivism, underreporting of violence, underutilization of healthcare resources, strained relationships, family separation, and unsafe environments. CONCLUSIONS: More research is needed to understand the social, economic, and political contexts that perpetuate sexual violence among justice-involved women. Universal healthcare, participatory research, changing cultural mindsets, decriminalization of sex work, and more comprehensive tracking and prosecution of sexual predators may be key to ending sexual violence in justice-involved mothers. © 2022.

We used consensual qualitative research methods and identified the following themes: (a) recognizing the endemic nature of racial violence, (b) feeling frozen in fear after a new case of racial violence, and (c) transforming grief into grievance as a route to racial justice. The findings contextualize Black mothers’ concerns about the racial violence that they and their children might experience during their lifetime, and how they channel this grief into actionable change against racial injustice.

We conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with self-identified Black women over the age of 18 who have had an abortion. The primary identified theme is that “choice” around abortion is a privilege that is not always available to Black women. Participants discussed domains of experience around abortion. The domains were (1) community experience and intergenerational wisdom, (2) personal experience and beliefs, (3) the process of accessing abortion, and (4) reflecting on abortion experience and recovery. Understanding the ways in which reproductive injustices and structural racism constrict choices is critical to providing abortion care. Abortion care should seek to honor the experiences of Black women, trust in the expertise that Black women have in our own bodies, and work to provide Reproductive-Justice-informed care. © The Author(s) 2022.},

In this article, we stand by these calls, contributing to them with the identification of the structural form of violence that a care ethical relational approach to reproductive care is up against: that of “maternal separation”. Confronted with reproductive and obstetric violence globally, we show that a hegemonic racialized, instrumentalized, and individualized conception of pregnancy is responsible for a severance of relationalities that are essential to safe reproductive care: (1) the relation between the person and their child or reproductive capabilities; and (2) the relation between the pregnant person and their community of care. We pinpoint a separation of the maternal relation in at least two discursive domains, namely, the juridical-political and the ethical-existential. Consequently, we plea for a radical re-imagination of maternal relationality, envisioning what care ethical midwifery, including abortion care, could be. © The Author(s) 2022.},

Breast pumps and breast pump accessories may help patients establish and maintain breastfeeding, but these technologies continue to evolve and are not always intuitive. The core components of a pump are the attachment at the breast, valves, tubing, motor, device programming, and reservoir. Whereas closed systems can be used by multiple patients, open systems are single-user and they are not able to be sterilized. Mobile pumps may help support breastfeeding individuals who are unable to remain stationary for the time necessary to express milk. Nonelectric pumps represent an important adjuvant technology. There are a wide variety of pump accessories that may help patients overcome specific breastfeeding challenges.

	abstract = {Public-sector healthcare providers in low- and middle-income countries are a primary source of family planning but their disrespectful (i.e., demeaning or insulting) treatment of family planning clients may impede free contraceptive choice. The construct of disrespect and abuse has been widely applied to similar phenomena in maternity care and could help to better understand provider mistreatment of family planning clients. With a focus on public-sector family planning provision in western Kenya, we aim to estimate the prevalence and impact of disrespect and abuse from a variety of perspectives and advance methodological approaches to measuring this construct in the context of family planning provision. We combine and triangulate data from a variety of sources across five counties in western Kenya, including 180 mystery clients, 253 third-party observations, eight focus group discussions, 19 key informant interviews, and two journey mapping workshops. Across both mystery client and third-party observations conducted in public-sector facilities in western Kenya, approximately one out of every ten family planning seekers was treated with disrespect by their provider. Family planning clients were frequently scolded for seeking family planning while unmarried or low parity, but mistreatment was not limited to women with these specific characteristics. Women were also insulted for such characteristics as body size or perceived sexual promiscuity. Qualitative data confirmed both that client disrespect is widespread and leads women to avoid family planning services even when they desire to use a contraceptive method, sometimes leading to unintended pregnancies. Key informants attribute disrespectful provider practices to both low technical skill as well as poor motivation stemming from both intrinsic values as well as extrinsic factors such as low wages and high caseloads. Possible solutions suggested by key informants included changes to recruitment and admission for Kenyan medical/nursing schools, as well as values clarification to shift provider motivations. Interventions to reduce mistreatment must be multi-layered and well-evidenced to ensure that family planning clients receive the person-centered care that enables them to achieve their contraceptive desires and reproductive freedom. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Background: American Indian/Alaskan Native (AI/AN) women disproportionally experience postpartum depression in the United States as compared to the rest of the population. Despite being disproportionately represented, the current body of knowledge lacks research on depression in this particular population. Specifically, the current literature lacks research pertaining to the experiences of postpartum AI/AN women, their culture, birthing and mothering expectations, and trauma. This qualitative study used the theories of becoming a mother, historical-trauma framework, and reproductive justice as they relate to Indigenous women’s personal and historical trauma to assess their lived experiences of becoming a mother. Methods: Keetoowah mothers (N = 8) were interviewed by using a story inquiry method to understand the perinatal experiences of members of one Indigenous tribe in the US. Findings: The story inquiry coding resulted in two main themes, namely maternal mental health challenges and inadequacies of perinatal care. Conclusion: The subthemes illuminate the intersection of historical trauma and the perinatal experience, continued colonization of mothering, and the resilience of tribal culture during the postpartum period. Implications include advocacy for increasing culturally derived perinatal interventions, increased healthcare coverage of culturally appropriate birthing practices, and future research evaluating the correlation between historical trauma and maternal mental health challenges. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Background: Tubal ligation remains common in the USA, especially among low-income patients. Objective: To compare the effectiveness and safety of intrauterine contraceptives (IUC) to laparoscopic tubal ligation for Medicaid clients. Design: We partnered with patient and clinician stakeholders to conduct a retrospective cohort study using California Medicaid claims for patients who had an IUC placed or laparoscopic tubal ligation performed in 2008–2014, excluding procedures performed within 42 days of a birth. We applied log-linear (Poisson) event-history regression models for clustered person-period data to adjust for sociodemographic variables and pre-procedure health status when examining associations between these contraceptive procedures and claims related to contraceptive failure, complications, and pain in the first year post-procedure. Key Results: We identified 35,705 patients who had a levonorgestrel IUC placed, 23,628 patients who had a copper IUC placed, and 23,965 patients who underwent laparoscopic tubal ligation. In unadjusted analyses, rates of pregnancy within 1 year were similar following levonorgestrel IUC (2.40%) or copper IUC placement (2.99%) or tubal ligation (2.64%). In adjusted analyses, compared to tubal ligation, pregnancy was less common following placement of a levonorgestrel IUC (adj IRR 0.72, 95% CI 0.64–0.82) and similar with placement of a copper IUC (adj IRR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82–1.05). Procedural complications such as infection (0.35% vs. 2.91%) were significantly less common with IUC placement than tubal ligation. Claims for pelvic and abdominal pain decreased in frequency with time since all procedures; 6 to 12 months post-procedure, pelvic pain claims were less common after levonorgestrel IUC (adj IRR 0.69, 95% CI 0.65–0.73) or copper IUC placement (adj IRR 0.70, 95% CI 0.66–0.75) than tubal ligation. Conclusions: IUC appears at least as effective as laparoscopic tubal ligation at 1-year post-procedure with lower rates of infection and pelvic pain 6 to 12 months post-procedure. © 2022, The Author(s).},

The authors posit that increasing students’ exposure to and understanding of abortion is necessary in the preparation of competent social work practitioners. Using Begun et al.’s (2016) Social Workers’ Abortion Attitudes, Knowledge, and Training questionnaire, the authors expanded the survey by creating additional questions about social work curriculum coverage and training experiences, as well as further content on abortion. Findings indicate that most social work students believe abortion should be legal in at least some circumstances, and also that abortion laws should be less restrictive in the United States. Reported religion and political affiliation had significant effects on several of the abortion attitude statements. Only 7.2% of respondents indicated that abortion is regularly discussed in social work classrooms, and only 2.7% of respondents report they have received training on the topic of abortion in their field placement. The results suggest that social work curriculum coverage on reproductive justice is tenuous and inconsistent at best, leaving students to grapple without the necessary professional foundation. © The Author(s) 2021.},

Profiled are the three most influential women within the UMW and its predecessors: Thelma Stevens, Peggy Billings, and Theressa Hoover. It briefly describes the effect that the Religious Right had on progressive women, and concludes with a brief discussion of the current debate over human sexuality within Methodism.

	abstract = {Most historiographies of the crossroads of environmental and reproductive health in 20th century start and end with the case of thalidomide. Despite its global scope, thalidomide today stands for sharp contrasts: in the numbers of victims, in institutional responses to the disaster, and also—more generally—in regulatory approaches to potential risks and national cultures of reproductive justice and disability rights. This paper takes a closer look at two countries that have been seen as emblematic of this divide in regulatory frameworks, despite similarities and interconnections in other areas, such as (pharma)industrial production, science, and robust feminist environmental health movements: the U.S. and West Germany. It argues that thalidomide needs to be historically contextualized within a broad framework of concepts and models of environment from research on exogenous reproductive effects. To do so, it reconstructs what counted as environment in research on reproductive health and birth defects in these two national settings in the postwar decades. It looks at transformations made across multifaceted initiatives, studying collective landscapes and workplaces as potentially dangerous “outer worlds,” as well as smaller scale and more individualized environments, i.e., the maternal metabolism, uterus, lifestyle, or social interactions. The article thereby aims to explicate concepts and debates about the environment that influenced later national divisions in politics of science and technology, hinting of the democratic challenges these posed. © 2022},

Objective: This methods paper offers a model for using Public Health Critical Race Praxis (PHCRP) and related critical methodologies (ie, feminist and decolonizing methods) to inform the conceptualization, methods, and dissemination of qualitative research undertaken in response to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. Sample: Using purposive snowball sampling, we identified organizations involved with health equity and social justice advocacy among BIPOC and socially marginalized populations. Focus group participants (N=63) included community members, organizers, activists, and health workers. Design: We conducted topic-specific (eg, reproductive justice) and population-specific (eg, Asian and Pacific Islander) focus groups (N=16 focus groups) in rapid succession using Zoom software. Methods: A self-reflexive, iterative praxis guided theorization, data collection and analysis. We obtained community input on study design, the semi-structured discussion guide, ethical considerations and dissemination. Applying PHCRP, we assessed our assumptions iteratively. We transcribed each interview verbatim, de-identified the data, then used two distinct qualitative techniques to code and analyze them: thematic analysis to identify unifying concepts that recur across focus groups and narrative analysis to keep each participant’s story intact. Results: The praxis facilitated relationship-building with partners and supported the iterative assessment of assumptions. Logistical constraints included difficulty ensuring the confidentiality of virtual discussions. Conclusions: These novel approaches provide an effective model for community-engaged qualitative research during a pandemic. © 2022 Ethnicity and Disease, Inc.. All rights reserved.},

In this article, I argue that there are no procreative moral rights, in that generally we do not have a distinctive moral right to procreate or not to procreate as we choose. However, interference with our procreative choices usually violates our nonprocreative moral rights, such as our moral rights to bodily autonomy or to privacy. My argument presents hypothetical cases in which a state interferes with a person's procreative choices in order to promote aggregate social welfare, but this interference does not violate any of the person's nonprocreative moral rights. These cases not only undermine frequently made claims that widely recognized nonprocreative moral rights entail procreative moral rights, they also challenge the intuitively plausible claim that interference with our procreative choices as such violates our moral rights. What at first appear to be substantive moral rights are in fact a kind of illusion created by the frequent overlap of other rights, but lacking in substance beyond that overlap. While this argument against the existence of procreative moral rights has substantive implications for ongoing debates in reproductive ethics, I ultimately suggest that it is consistent with a progressive approach to reproductive justice. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {This study utilized a social media post by a well-known social media influencer and the accompanying 63 responses to explore feelings and experiences related to abortion. This study employed qualitative thematic analysis and identified three themes related to reasons for abortion (i.e., relationship issues, not being ready for pregnancy, and other reasons) and one supplemental theme of bystander support. Findings highlight the efforts of many respondents to normalize abortion as an issue of women’s health and women’s rights. In fact, in response to the original post’s discussion regarding valid reasons for an abortion, most respondents remarked similarly that any reason is valid. While study limitations include concerns regarding generalizability, this study provides access to abortion experiences outside of a traditional health clinic survey and insight into the abortion beliefs of women, both who have and have not experienced an abortion. Findings are in line with previous studies which found that multiple reasons are cited for obtaining an abortion, but also revealed a more supportive climate than the divisive discourse typically portrayed in the media. This suggests the timing may be conducive for efforts aiming to normalize abortion and reduce stigma, including potential avenues for interventions (e.g., social networks and platforms). Lastly, the innovative use of social media to inform this study should be considered by others as they seek to understand and explore topics that can be challenging to study. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Efforts to reduce the incidence of unintended pregnancy by expanding access to and use of a new generation of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) in recent years led to the wide-spread adoption of a tiered effectiveness (i.e., LARC-first) approach to contraceptive counseling in clinical practice. While reproductive justice scholar-advocates have critiqued this approach for how it may limit pregnancy-capable people's reproductive decision-making, less work in this area has examined efforts to prevent unintended pregnancy via contraceptive counseling as an interactional process shaped by social norms and inequities. Using individual interviews with clinicians working in obstetrics and gynecology that examined their approaches to contraceptive care delivery, this article draws on the sociological theory of interactional accountability to argue that clinicians hold their women patients accountable to social norms about pregnancy prevention in their attempts to persuade them to use LARC. Qualitative data analysis reveals that clinicians center their own contraceptive preferences and behaviors, prioritize pregnancy prevention via LARC use above other priorities patients may have, and communicate that contraceptive use is compulsory for women of reproductive age. By mobilizing their medical authority under the guise of achieving seemingly value-neutral public health goals, clinicians obscure the role that normative assumptions about reproductive behavior play in their practices of contraceptive counseling. By highlighting the strategies clinicians use to enact LARC-first contraceptive counseling as a normative accountability structure, this article demonstrates how these practices curtail women's reproductive autonomy and undermine ongoing efforts to achieve reproductive justice. © 2022 The Author},

Individuals experience numerous social, political, and economic barriers following incarceration; however, little is known about the incarceration experiences of Latina mothers in Texas, who are disproportionately affected. This study aims to examine the experiences of Latina mothers impacted by incarceration, using reproductive justice as a sensitizing lens. We used a qualitative description design and twelve Latina mothers were interviewed. We used semi-structured, individual, interviews to address the research question, “What are the experiences of Latina mothers impacted by incarceration?” We applied the reproductive justice framework to inductively sensitize the experiences with respect to the right to bodily autonomy, right to have or not have children, and right to parent in safe, sustainable environments following arrest. An overarching theme (We’re still human) and four major themes (I did whatever they wanted me to do; It’s me against the world; Even through the pain you push through; Our voices haven’t been heard loud enough) emerged from our analysis of interview data. These themes describe experiences of discrimination, trauma, barriers, resiliency, and desires, following arrest. The findings indicate a need for more research that takes an intersectional approach; policy reform that humanizes those influenced by arrest; bridging initiatives on the individual, relational, community, and societal levels; and making probation and medication-assisted therapy services mother-centered. © 2022 Taylor & Francis.},

However, in an era of partisan polarization, Title X has become a political and symbolic pawn, in part because of its connection to family planning organizations like Planned Parenthood. The conflicts around Title X highlight the effects of intertwining abortion politics and contraception policy, particularly as they relate to reproductive justice and gendered policy making. Family planning organizations like Planned Parenthood have responded to these battles by bowing out of the Title X network. To what extent have contraception deserts-places characterized by inequitable access to Title X-developed or expanded in response to policy changes related to contraception and reproductive health? What is the demographic makeup of these spaces of inequality? We leverage data from the Office of Population Affairs and the U.S. Census Bureau and use the integrated two-step floating catchment area method to illustrate the effects of a major change in the Title X network in 10 states. Our results reveal the widespread human ramifications of increasing constraints on family planning organizations as a result of quiet but insidious federal bureaucratic rule changes.  © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Climate change disproportionately impacts women, particularly those who are already restricted by gender inequality. Climate related events (CRE), such as extreme weather events, droughts, rising sea levels, leave millions vulnerable. Increasingly, the sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) of women are negatively impacted during and post climate change related events. In the absence of climate related events, access to SRHR services is already limited due to economic, cultural, and social constraints that prevent women from making decisions concerning their bodily autonomy. During and post climate disasters, such constrains are worsened. Limited access to SRHR services increases women's risk of physical, mental, and psychological harm; it also impacts on their ability to build capacity and resilience to climate change. This article examines the rise in climate related events in Bangladesh and the corresponding harm of climate change on women's access to sexual and reproductive health care. The article argues that the impact of climate change on women needs to be viewed through a reproductive justice framework. The first step to prevent the gendered impacts of climate change is for international and national frameworks to identify individual needs to build capacity and resilience.

	abstract = {Obstetrics, the specialty overseeing infant and parent health before birth, could be expanded to address the interrelated areas of parents’ prenatal impact on children's brain development and their own psychosocial needs during a time of immense change and neuroplasticity. Obstetrics is primed for the shift that is happening in pediatrics, which is moving from its traditional focus on physical health to a coordinated, whole-child, 2- or multigeneration approach. Pediatric care now includes developmental screening, parenting education, parent coaching, access to developmental specialists, brain-building caregiving skills, linkages to community resources, and tiered interventions with psychologists. Drawing on decades of developmental origins of health and disease research highlighting the prenatal beginnings of future health and new studies on the transition to parenthood describing adult development from pregnancy to early postpartum, we have proposed that, similar to pediatrics, the integration of education and intervention strategies into the prenatal care ecosystem should be tested for its potential to improve child cognitive and social-emotional development and parental mental health. Pediatric care programs can serve as models of change for the systematic development, testing and, incorporation of new content into prenatal care as universal, first-tier treatment and evidenced-based, triaged interventions according to the level of need. To promote optimal beginnings for the whole family, we have proposed an augmented prenatal care ecosystem that aligns with, and could build on, current major efforts to enhance perinatal care individualization through consideration of medical, social, and structural determinants of health. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

Memphis, Tennessee, has a history of limited community birth options (birthing outside of hospital walls). In 2017, when home birth services were added to CHOICES and plans for opening Memphis’ first freestanding birth center were being imagined, it was intentional to create a model in which midwifery care could be accessible for patients who may be eligible for state-funded health care services, those considered at higher health risk than traditional low-risk midwifery patients, or both. In fact, individuals and their families with limited out-of-pocket funds and those historically marginalized would purposely receive holistic, individualized care based on their unique health care needs and personal desires, driven by a reproductive justice framework. In this article, we outline the success and challenges of addressing the reproductive health needs of marginalized communities, including the benefits of a nonprofit business model, operationalizing reproductive justice concepts, and the reclamation of Black midwifery. We also discuss the challenges of caring for Black birthing people and providing abortion and gender-affirming care in a politically hostile environment. Although individuals have complex needs, at its core, CHOICES believes that every person must be seen as whole human beings and that each can be cared for by a midwife. The CHOICES approach is informed by evidence-based information, clinical judgment, and an intentional partnership with and investment in a people who have historically been and are presently pushed to the margins, neglected, and blamed for poor health outcomes and demise. Striving to adapt the CHOICES model of care in other parts of the country is important now more than ever following the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. © 2022 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.},

However, in contemporary obstetrical practice, the Medicaid sterilization policy serves as a policy-level barrier to autonomously desired care. We review the clinical and ethical implications of the current Medicaid sterilization policy. After discussing the utility and impact of waiting periods for other surgical procedures, we explore the psychology of time required for decision-making and consider scientific understanding of regret. We argue that the current Medicaid sterilization waiting period is clinically and ethically unjustifiable and that the policy ought to be revised in light of the goals, preferences, and concerns of the people most affected by it. While the need for continued protection against coercion remains, the current mandated waiting period does little to enforce the high-quality shared decision-making that is desired for sterilization counseling. © 2022 The Hastings Center.},

Study design: This qualitative study involved individual interviews with 15 clinicians working in obstetrics and gynecology in South Carolina about their approaches to contraceptive counseling. We analyzed the data using a combination of deductive and inductive approaches. Results: Clinicians attributed challenges of working with diverse patient populations to patients’ race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and age. Clinicians often interpreted patient concerns about or refusal to use effective contraceptive methods as a problem with patients themselves. When clinicians described patients in disparaging ways, they often focused on adolescent patients. Conclusion: Bias informed by structural inequalities and power relations influences how clinicians perceive their patients and approach counseling them about contraception. Such practices may limit patients’ informed decision-making and autonomy regarding initiating or continuing contraceptive use. Implications: Greater attention to redressing structural inequalities and power relations that inform provider bias in the context of contraceptive counseling is needed to ensure patients receive person-centered healthcare free from prejudice and discrimination. Fostering structural competency among clinicians may improve provider-patient interactions and support patients' reproductive autonomy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The benefits of breastmilk and lactation are well established for both infants and women. National organizations recommend exclusively breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life and continued breastfeeding for the first 1-2 years of life. For physicians, childbearing years often coincide with key periods of training and their early career. Physician mothers have high rates of initiating breastfeeding but low success in maintaining breastfeeding. Breastfeeding discontinuation among physicians is a well-described, multifactorial issue that has persisted for decades. Reasons for discontinuation include inadequate access to pumping rooms, insufficient workplace and coworker support, and constrained schedules. Pumping is viewed as a burden to teammates and superiors, and physicians are often required to make up time spent pumping. Vague or absent policies to support breastfeeding by accreditation organizations and institutions create workplace conflict and impose additional stress on breastfeeding physicians, who devote significant time, energy, and mental reserves navigating clinical responsibilities, workplace relationships, and licensing requirements to pump. The authors propose several recommendations to improve the environment, support, and resources for breastfeeding physicians with a focus on what individuals, institutions, and professional organizations can do. Creating lactation policies that allow breastfeeding physicians equitable participation in the workplace is a matter of reproductive justice. Improving the collective awareness and support for breastfeeding trainees and physicians is a critical step in recruiting, retaining, and supporting women in medicine. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

This recounting draws attention to the historical legacy of inequality based on race, gender, and class. In Section three, the ethical implications of climate change are presented and discussed through the analytical lens of green criminology and reproductive justice. These implications include a feminist reclaiming of full bodily autonomy for poor women and girls of color, given the health and social inequalities they disproportionately experience. © 2022, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.},

Recently, there has been an uptick in research funding to identify and address root causes, particularly among at-risk groups. However, given the historical trauma experienced by Black populations in research settings, novel approaches built firmly on ethical principles and grounded in a framework of reproductive justice are necessary to minimize harm and center the research process on maintaining the dignity and respect of research participants. Methods: Ethical principles as outlined by the American Nurses Association, Black Mamas Matter Alliance, and federal research guidelines are reviewed within the context of conducting maternal mortality-focused research. In addition, community developed research frameworks and methodologies are presented and discussed within the research context. Conclusions: Black pregnant people have reported mistreatment during clinical encounters; therefore, intentional protections to promote safety must be considered in the research setting. Ethical principles must be considered when designing and implementing research initiatives focused on addressing maternal mortality risk in Black communities. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

	abstract = {For more than a century, substantial racial and ethnic inequities in perinatal health outcomes have persisted despite technical clinical advances and changes in public health practice that lowered the overall incidence of morbidity. Race is a social construct and not an inherent biologic or genetic reality; therefore, racial differences in health outcomes represent the consequences of structural racism or the inequitable distribution of opportunities for health along racialized lines. Clinicians and scientists in obstetrics and gynecology have a responsibility to work to eliminate health inequities for Black, Brown, and Indigenous birthing people, and fulfilling this responsibility requires actionable evidence from high-quality research. To generate this actionable evidence, the research community must realign paradigms, praxis, and infrastructure with an eye directed toward reproductive justice and antiracism. This special report offers a set of key recommendations as a roadmap to transform perinatal health research to achieve health equity. The recommendations are based on expert opinion and evidence presented at the State of the Science Research Symposium at the 41st Annual Pregnancy Meeting of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine in 2021. Recommendations fall into 3 broad categories—changing research paradigms, reforming research praxis, and transforming research infrastructure—and are grounded in a historic foundation of the advances and shortcomings of clinical, public health, and sociologic scholarship in health equity. Changing the research paradigm requires leveraging a multidisciplinary perspective on structural racism; promoting mechanistic research that identifies the biologic pathways perturbed by structural racism; and utilizing conceptual models that account for racism as a factor in adverse perinatal outcomes. Changing praxis approaches to promote and engage multidisciplinary teams and to develop standardized guidelines for data collection will ensure that paradigm shifts center the historically marginalized voices of Black, Brown, and Indigenous birthing people. Finally, infrastructure changes that embed community-centered approaches are required to make shifts in paradigm and praxis possible. Institutional policies that break down silos and support true community partnership, and also the alignment of institutional, funding, and academic publishing objectives with strategic priorities for perinatal health equity, are paramount. Achieving health equity requires shifting the structures that support the ecosystem of racism that Black, Brown, and Indigenous birthing people must navigate before, during, and after childbearing. These structures extend beyond the healthcare system in which clinicians operate day-to-day, but they cannot be excluded from research endeavors to create the actionable evidence needed to achieve perinatal health equity. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

Wade, removing almost 50 years of precedent and enabling the imposition of a wide range of state-level restrictions on abortion access. Historical data from the United States and internationally demonstrate that the removal of safe abortion options will increase complications and the health risks to pregnant patients. Because the emergency department is a critical access point for reproductive health care, emergency clinicians must be prepared for the policy, clinical, educational, and legal implications of this change. The goal of this paper, therefore, is to describe the impact of the reversal of Roe v. Wade on health equity and reproductive justice, the provision of emergency care education and training, and the specific legal and reproductive consequences for emergency clinicians.

	abstract = {The Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade framed the abortion right as the right to make an abortion decision in consultation with a “responsible physician.” Under this framing, doctors were cast into the role of medical “gatekeepers” to mediate patient access to abortion. In the ensuing years, the doctor-patient relationship has become the site of restrictive abortion regulations in many states. This Article argues that Roe’s framing suffers from a foundational flaw: while the gatekeeper framing may have been appropriate in the Roe era when abortion was surgical and non-clinical abortions were potentially lethal, today, medication abortion—a two-drug non-surgical regimen that can safely and effectively terminate a pregnancy at home—renders the Court’s gatekeeper framing obsolete and no longer reflects the technological or medical realities of abortion-related healthcare. This Article reasserts the constitutional right to abortion and argues that advances in medical technology call for a new framing for the right as one of direct access to abortion that is not dependent upon the provider-patient relationship. This framing is better suited to protect the breadth and depth of the abortion right because it reflects the new technological realities of the practice of abortion and the promise of abortion care outside of the medical gatekeeper model, which has been the focus of restrictive regulation and clinic harassment. It is a critical time to re-examine the gatekeeper framing of the abortion right considering the dramatic conservative shift in the Supreme Court that threatens Roe, and in the midst of a pandemic, which—in a complete reversal of the Roe period—renders in-person care by a provider potentially dangerous. In January, the Supreme Court’s first abortion decision since President Trump’s appointment of three justices, FDA v. American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists (“ACOG”), doubled down on the medical gatekeeper model by reinstating an FDA requirement that medication abortion pills must be dispensed in person by a provider. Re-examining the historical, social, and technological assumptions that animate the current framing of the abortion right is vital to thinking of new ways to frame and expand abortion access. Today’s online medical and pharmaceutical marketplaces reveal that the Court’s confined vision of the abortion right was informed by the social and technological realities of its time—social and technological realities that no longer exist. If Roe’s cramped vision of the abortion right has run its course, as I argue here, then the movement to protect access to abortion must include direct consumer access to abortion. Empirical evidence reveals widespread use of self-managed medication abortion in the face of abortion restrictions. The shuttering of clinics as “non-essential services” during the COVID-19 pandemic and the unnecessary increased risk of clinic-based care for procedures that can be safely managed at home only amplify the need for direct-to-consumer access to abortion care. As state legislatures seek to make it easier to prosecute individuals suspected of terminating their own pregnancies, it is a crucial moment to reconsider the constitutional foundation of the abortion right and the right to self-managed care as a matter of criminal and reproductive justice and public health. © 2022 Cornell Law School.

The article draws on evidence from three ethnographic studies conducted between 2008 and 2017 to shed light on the predicaments of mothers and pregnant women excluded from the welfare safety-net, who were flying under the radar due to the fear of deportation. It shows how (cr)immigration controls render women vulnerable to victimization and harm. The second part of the article addresses imprisonment and punishment, treatment by the criminal justice system, and separation from children placed in foster care. The evidence strongly suggests that controls in Britain disrupt the core principles of reproductive justice, including reproductive autonomy and health, and to parent children in a safe and healthy environment without fear of retaliation from the government.

	abstract = {During the Trump Administration, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Directive (11032.3) revoked the automatic release of pregnant women detained by ICE. This paper presents a policy analysis of the impact of this directive on pregnant Latina migrants. The directive is contextualized as part of the Trump Administration’s “zero-tolerance” immigration policy that directed U.S. attorney’s offices along the southwest border in April of 2018 to criminally prosecute all cases involving illegal entry with no exceptions. Under this policy, Latin American migrants seeking asylum in the USA faced criminalization, family separation, and detention. Reproductive justice (R.J.) is the guiding conceptual framework for analyzing this policy's impact. Three case studies demonstrate the reproductive and human rights violations impacting pregnant, migrant Latinas seeking to enter the U.S. under “zero-tolerance.” This policy did not deter migration from Central and South America and created avoidable harm. Although “zero-tolerance” was rescinded in 2021, the long-term impacts remain unknown. Implications and recommendations for social work practice, policy advocacy, and social work education are provided. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

This historical connection is reflected in the rhetorical and ideological similarities between predation TERFism and Zionism, both of which are defined by an “extinction phobia” that confuses oppressor and oppressed, presenting the subordinate party as capable of eliminating the dominant one. This extinction phobia transforms into “right-wing annihilationism” via a dehumanization of the subordinate party as innately harmful and therefore requiring elimination; hence the hallmark predation TERF abjection of trans women as rapists of cis women and the Zionist abjection of Palestinians as “savage” and/or “terrorist.” These connections can be obscured by the siloization of social justice movement work in the United States, wherein anti-colonial and anti-imperial organizing is often separated from organizing for gender and reproductive justice and sexual freedom. Recognizing the continuities, however—whether historical, material, or ideological—between predation TERFism and Zionism offers useful lessons for understanding not only the power of the contemporary global anti-trans resurgence, but also how we might build solidaristic, anti-colonial movements to defeat it. © 2022 Duke University Press.},

	abstract = {Almost half of all pregnancies each year in the United States are mistimed or unwanted and associated with adverse health outcomes. Deaf women are as likely to be pregnant as their hearing counterparts but are 67% more likely to experience unintended pregnancy. Although there are limited data on the sexual health behaviors of deaf individuals, research has shown that deaf people are more likely than the general population to rely on withdrawal and condoms to prevent pregnancy. Further, health resources and communication with physicians are often not fully accessible, with the former often in spoken or written English and the latter when sign language interpreters are not present. The combination of use of less - effective methods of contraception and inaccessible health resources puts deaf women at heightened risk for unintended pregnancy. Deaf women are denied reproductive justice when they are inadequately equipped to practice bodily autonomy and prevent unintended pregnancies. In this commentary, I present literature to illustrate the disparity deaf women face compared with hearing women and to make the case for the association among unintended pregnancy, its adverse effects, and reproductive injustice for deaf women. As a medically trained deaf woman conducting reproductive health research, I leverage my lived experience and accrued knowledge to elucidate the shortcomings and strategies to use. As public health researchers and health care professionals, we can alleviate this injustice with inclusive research methodology, representation on research and health care teams, and ensuring access to health information with time given and accommodations provided.  © 2022 by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.},

	abstract = {Objective: The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program grants young, undocumented immigrants work authorization and protections from deportation, with about 1.3 million eligible for the program. This exploratory study examines the association between DACA status and contraceptive use among undocumented young adults. Study design: We conducted an internet-based survey between June 2017 and August 2017 among Asian and Latinx undocumented immigrants (N = 204) aged 18–31 years in California. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were conducted to examine the associations between DACA status and contraceptive use and consistency. Results: Among undocumented participants who were sexually active, about 60% reported having unprotected sex (52% DACA vs. 63% non-DACA) and about 80% reported that documentation status affects how they access care for sexual/reproductive health at least a little. Overall, Asians were 81% less likely to have unprotected sex compared to Latinx individuals (aOR = 0.19, 95%CI: 0.06, 0.56). DACA recipients were more likely to report using contraception every time compared to non-recipients (42.9% vs. 30.5%, p = 0.04). DACA recipients were 63% less likely to report having unprotected sex in the past 12 months compared to those without DACA (aOR = 0.37, 95%CI: 0.14, 0.99). DACA recipients were more than three times as likely to use contraception during sex every time compared to those without DACA (aOR = 3.19, 95%CI: 1.19, 8.54). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that undocumented young adults have low rates of contraceptive use; however, DACA is associated with improved reproductive health for certain undocumented immigrants. Implications and contribution: State and federal policies that extend protections and promote immigrant integration are needed to fully achieve reproductive justice for all. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Infant mental health is interconnected with and affected by maternal mental health. A mother or birthing person's mental health before and during pregnancy and the postpartum period is essential for a child's development. During the first year of life, infants require emotional attachment and bonding to strive. Perinatal mood disorders are likely to hinder attachment and are associated with an increased risk of adverse mental health effects for children later in life. The Black community is faced with a crisis as Black mothers experience a higher prevalence of perinatal mood disorders, including postpartum depression and anxiety, compared to the United States national estimates. The aim of the research is to identify social, structural, and economic disparities of Black perinatal women and birthing people's experience to understand the impact of perinatal mental health on infants' mental health. Black mothers and birthing people may often face social and structural barriers that limit their opportunity to seek and engage with interventions and treatment that address the root causes of their perinatal mood disorder. To enhance understanding of racial disparities caused by social and structural determinants of health on Black mothers and birthing people's mental health and health care experiences that influence infant mental health, the study team conducted semi-structured interviews among self-identified cisgender Black women health professionals nationwide, who provide care to pregnant or postpartum Black women and birthing people. Our study attempted to identify themes, pathways, interventions, and strategies to promote equitable and anti-racist maternal and infant mental health care. Using a Rigorous and Accelerated Data Reduction (Radar) technique and a deductive qualitative analytic approach it was found that limited access to resources, lack of universal screening and mental health education, and the disjointed healthcare system serves as barriers, contribute to mental health issues, and put Black mothers and birthing people at a disadvantage in autonomous decision making. Our study concluded that instituting education on healthy and culturally appropriate ways to support infant development in parent education programs may support Black parents in establishing healthy attachment and bonds. Prioritizing strategies to improve maternal mental health and centering Black parents in developing these educational parenting programs may optimize parenting experiences.

	abstract = {As the United States' largest public health insurance program, Medicaid has since 1965 played a crucial role in the struggle for equitable health care access. It has the potential to be a powerful instrument of reproductive justice, yet discriminatory policies that deny coverage for vital sexual, reproductive, or other health services, or exclude entire populations of people with low incomes from coverage altogether, constrain peoples' health and reproductive futures. Resulting discrimination in Medicaid law and policy thwart the program's ability to promote intergenerational health equity and reproductive justice for underserved communities.This Article provides an account of why reproductive justice is a necessary framework for examining, reimagining, and reforming Medicaid coverage law and policy. Part I gives a brief history and overview of reproductive justice, which serves as "an open source code that people have used to pursue fresh critical thinking regarding power and powerlessness." Part II argues that we should utilize that open source code in Medicaid coverage reform. Using some of the reproductive justice movement's critiques as a starting point, it explores how reproductive oppression has shaped Medicaid coverage law, policy, and mainstream reproductive and health care reform movements' proposals, and to what effect. It argues that examining Medicaid law, policy, and proposed reforms through this lens and in collaboration with the reproductive justice movement can enable health advocates and policymakers to more fully understand, disrupt, and dismantle reproductive injustices that drive health inequities.

	abstract = {As rates with which women are incarcerated have risen around the world, research examining how incarceration affects the health of people who are pregnant, their newborns, and their family members has burgeoned. Lived experience is seldom accounted for in this research, however, highlighting a gap with relevance to advocates, policy makers, researchers, and practitioners seeking to better understand health inequities and redress human suffering. In this paper we present a qualitative meta-synthesis of 31 papers reporting qualitative studies of how people who are incarcerated in prisons and jails around the world experience pregnancy, labour and childbirth, and the postpartum period. Theoretical perspectives from the reproductive justice and prison abolition movements guided our analysis, which identified connectedness (to baby) and disconnectedness (from support) as twinned themes characterizing the lived experiences of navigating pregnancy in a carceral institution. We argue that the conditions of reproductive justice – including self-determination in pregnancy, in parenting, and in managing one's reproductive capacity – are fundamentally irreconcilable with mass incarceration. We conclude by considering the strategic opportunities for health practitioners and researchers to support the movement for prison abolition by mobilizing health-focused arguments for decarceration. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Reproductive Justice has become somewhat of a buzzword, inspiring qualitative research on a range of sexual and reproductive issues. However, uptake in psychology has been somewhat slow, in part due to the absence of well-defined methodology and rigorous methods for applying a Reproductive Justice framework. Psychology research claiming a Reproductive Justice approach often lacks specificity regarding its underlying theoretical assumptions and how the chosen methodology enables Reproductive Justice analysis. Failing to engage with the theoretical foundations of Reproductive Justice or explicate how these inform one’s work can lead to underdeveloped application, deviation from the central principles, and misappropriation of Reproductive Justice Theory, thus failing to realise its radical potential. Accordingly, focusing on the application of Reproductive Justice in qualitative psychology research, I discuss three core theoretical antecedents of Reproductive Justice and present three corresponding approaches to application, illustrated with examples. The objective is to offer concrete analytical strategies for applying Reproductive Justice theory and to stimulate further thinking and discussion regarding how the theory might be fruitfully and rigorously used in qualitative research in psychology. © 2022 Taylor & Francis.},

They also experience high rates of morbidity and mortality; however, there is limited data related to their health inequities. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate systemic inequities associated with discrimination using the Reproductive Justice Framework to observe factors that influenced depressive symptomology in Hispanic women. Methods: A path analysis was conducted to evaluate systemic inequities that influenced postpartum depression using the public database, Listening to Mothers III (LMIII). The sub-sample consisted of n = 406 Hispanic mothers. Data was initially collected between the years 2011 and 2013. Results: Hispanic mothers were more likely to experience occurrences of perceived discrimination while seeking perinatal healthcare. These occurrences of discrimination led to lower trust in their healthcare providers, lower satisfaction with care, more instances of unwanted medical procedures, the need to feel to hold back comments about their health which ultimately resulted in higher rates of self-reported postpartum depression. The model fit indices supported the model's plausibility (χ2/df ratio = 3.16, Comparative Fit Index = 0.91, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation = 0.06). Conclusions: This data supported our hypothesis that the pathway of discriminatory barriers Hispanic mothers experience during pregnancy influence postpartum depression. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

Religious convictions and communal obligations are also often involved in women’s struggles with reproductive choices.

In this article, I follow young former Conservative Laestadian women’s views on reproductive freedom, procreational ethos, and pronatalist politics. I propose that there is an ongoing upsurge among young former Conservative Laestadian women who resist the movement’s procreational ethos. I also suggest that the Laestadian procreational ethos has affinities with the nationalist and pronatalist aims of promoting limitless human reproduction.

This article brings together two streams of analysis by feminists of color: first, the analysis by Latin American feminists of the “war against women’s bodies” in the current phase of narcocapitalism and necrocapitalism in Mexico and Central America; and second, the analysis by scholars of gendered immigration enforcement (“crimmigration”) and reproductive oppression in the US. This transfeminist approach brings the US reproductive justice movement into conversation with a Latin American feminist critique of gendered necropolitics in the Americas, pointing the way toward a radical politics of embodied personhood and reproductive autonomy. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

This conceptualization is illustrated through interviews with women concerning their experiences of pregnancy and new motherhood while having precarious immigration status living in Montreal, Canada.

Although women are the fastest growing population in Canadian prisons, no one has studied the effect of their incarceration on access to abortion services. Studies outside of Canada indicate rates of abortion are higher among people experiencing incarceration than in the general population, and that abortion access is often problematic. Although international standards for abortion care among incarcerated populations exist, there conversely appear to be no Canadian guidelines or procedures to facilitate unintended pregnancy prevention or management. Barriers to abortion care inequitably restrict people with unintended pregnancy from attaining education and employment opportunities, cause entrenchment in violent relationships, and prevent people from choosing to parent when they are ready and able. Understanding and facilitating equitable access to abortion care for incarcerated people is critical to address structural, gender-, and race-based reproductive health inequities, and to promote reproductive justice. There is an urgent need for research in this area to direct best practices in clinical care and support policies capable to ensure equal access to abortion care for incarcerated people. © 2022 Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc..

	abstract = {Objective: We aimed to examine how peripartum contraceptive care quality improvement efforts address or perpetuate reproductive health injustices. Study design: We conducted a comparative case study of inpatient postpartum contraceptive care implementation in 2017 to 2018, using key informant interviews at 11 United States hospitals. After our primary analysis revealed tensions between enhancing access to contraceptive care and patient-centeredness, we conducted the current inductive content analysis guided by 4 questions developed post-hoc: (1) What are healthcare workers’ aspirations for contraceptive quality improvement programs? (2) What are healthcare workers’ biases regarding peripartum contraceptive care delivery? (3) Do care delivery processes center patients’ needs? (4) Do healthcare workers recognize and engage with structural inequities? Results: Seventy-eight key informants (i.e., clinicians, operations staff, administrators) participated. In nine study sites, we observed evidence of interviewees both mitigating and perpetuating reproductive injustice. Many aspired to provide compassionate, patient-centered care, avoid paternalism, and foster patient autonomy. Simultaneously, interviewees demonstrated biases, including implicit subscription to an ideology of stratified reproduction, stereotyping, and “othering.” Even when interviewees endorsed goals of patient-centeredness, care delivery processes sometimes prioritized healthcare systems’ needs, and patients were not included on quality improvement teams. Many interviewees recognized structural inequities as driving health outcome disparities, yet relied on individual-level solutions like long-acting reversible contraception, and not structural-level interventions, to address them. Conclusion: Alongside enthusiasm for delivering compassionate care exist biases, missed opportunities to center patients, and lack of curiosity about the appropriateness of solving structural-level problems with individual-level solutions. Implications: Our findings call for individual and institutional self-reflection, partnership with patients and communities, and other intentional efforts to mitigate potential for harm in initiatives enhancing access to contraceptive care. © 2022},

	abstract = {Objective: To assess New York State stakeholders’ perspectives regarding providing reproductive health services in primary care settings, including asking patients about pregnancy intentions and providing long-acting reversible contraception (LARC). Study design: We conducted semistructured key-informant interviews (n = 22) with stakeholders representing diverse sectors, including primary care (family medicine) and specialty (obstetrician/gynecologist) physicians, health educators/promoters, advocates, and public health/health care professionals. Grounded theory methodology informed sampling and thematic analysis within and across sectors. Results: Key informants across sectors supported integrating reproductive health services into primary care. Pregnancy intention screening was considered appropriate yet required improved measures. Such screening was viewed as fostering childbearing discussions and counseling for contraception/preconception health that could benefit patients while also requiring attention to concerns from the patient (e.g., potential for coercion, access barriers) and health care systems (e.g., buy-in, training) contexts. Three themes related to LARC included provider bias, knowledge and training, counseling and patient education, and logistics/financial situation, which were differentially emphasized by stakeholder sector; providers expressed greater concern regarding training, bias, and logistical considerations, whereas health educators and advocates focused on patient education and autonomous decision-making. Similarly, awareness of reproductive justice principles varied by sector. Conclusion: There is consensus among informants from the 5 sectors for expanding reproductive health services in primary care. This will require reproductive health-related training for providers, organizational buy-in, and system protocol changes, including unbiased contraceptive counseling of all methods, specifically balancing discussion of LARC effectiveness with information regarding side effects. Incorporating reproductive justice principles may increase informed patient decision-making and reproductive autonomy. Implications: Expanding reproductive health services in primary care requires provider training and protocols for patient-centered care, including unbiased provision of all contraceptive options. The reproductive justice framework offers the possibility of addressing diverse stakeholders’ concerns for both preconception and contraceptive care with patient decision-making at the forefront. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Previous studies have suggested that often, Black mothers’ birthing experiences are not what they expected because of how they were treated by healthcare providers during labor and birth. Our goal in this study was to ask Black mothers who had recently given birth about the quality of their birthing experiences as well as their level of respect from, trust in, and satisfaction with their maternity healthcare providers. Design: This study gathered data from Black mothers (N = 209) who had given birth within the past two years, using a cross-sectional online survey measuring several variables about the birthing experience including types of healthcare provider communication, provider respect for the mother, trust, birth satisfaction, and emotional responses to birth. Results: Provider-centered communication, although preferred by some mothers, was associated with lower birth satisfaction and stronger negative emotions whereas positive birth satisfaction was linked to patient-centered communication which resulted in positive emotions. While most mothers reported overall satisfaction with their birth experience, nearly half reported experiencing some degree of disrespect from their healthcare providers during labor and birth. Moreover, trust and respect mediated the relationship for patient-centered communication with positive emotion and birth satisfaction. Over one-third of participants gave birth with a certified nurse midwife attending. There were no differences in perception of being respected or the quality of birth given the professional identity of the provider as an Obstetrician/Gynecologist or as a midwife. The advice suggested by Black mothers for their healthcare providers was instructive in identifying ways those providers could better serve their patients during birth. Conclusion: This study showed that there is still additional work that needs to be done for racial equity and respect during birth. Practical implications for addressing health inequities are discussed. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Starting with this question, this article explores my own attraction to this tiny place in postindustrial and settler colonial Hamilton, Ontario. I am curious about what it can teach us about the complex entanglements of these things, and the toxic desires that are both enabled and foreclosed by the relations that gather here. In the first section, I briefly rehearse the basin’s toxic history and, guided by Audre Lorde’s definition of erotics and Catriona Sandilands formative work on queer ecologies, my own desirous attachments to the life it nonetheless sustains. The next section reveals how, in the context of settler colonialism and climate catastrophe, these erotics are queerly tangled in questions of more-than-human gender, sex, and reproduction, too, in ways that invite a capacious and multivalent understanding of reproductive justice. The final section examines the performance art of white settler ecosexuals Annie Sprinkle and Beth Stephens, but sets this alongside a performance by Vanessa Dion Fletcher at Windermere, in order to insist on a version of ecosexual erotics that, while joyous, remains imbricated in fraught histories, complicity, and an inalienable attention to what Michif scholar Max Liboiron parses as “differences and obligations.” Taking a cue from settler feminist artist and scholar Lindsay Kelley, I refer to this as “bad ecosex.” In its refusal of purity, bad ecosex holds the trouble of contemporary ecological relations together with the pleasurable power of erotics to build a politics of change grounded in feeling deeply. © 2022 Astrida Neimanis.},

Aggravating the situation, during the Covid-19 crisis, the Brazilian government accelerated the process of hollowing out the access to contraception and legal abortion services in the public health system. This has taken many forms-the most serious being the issuing of an executive measure imposing new formal barriers to access the right to legal abortion (Ordinance No 2282 of 27 August 27 2020). By using the Reproductive Justice Framework as a critical lens, this chapter unearths the inequality dimensions of reproduction-exponentiated by the combination of the Covid-19 crisis and the government's attacks on reproductive rights. Grounded in empirical data, it proposes the formulation of legal challenges to the Ordinance through the mobilization of the substantive equality approach. The equality-based argument envisioned in the chapter has as premise the idea that intersectional inequalities are related to social hierarchies and that equality, in turn, would demand the dismantling of such relations. It is argued that restrictions on abortion, when seen in context, emerge as issues that arise from, are permeated by, and perpetuate inequalities and, as such, should be legally treated accordingly. © The several contributors 2022.

	abstract = {Continuous labor support is an evidence-based practice demonstrated to improve birth outcomes, particularly when provided by a trained doula or birth companion. Access to doula services designed to meet the needs of historically underserved and diverse communities can mitigate the negative effects of structural racism and health disparities in perinatal care. Unfortunately, continuous labor support by a companion of choice is not universally supported. This leaves individuals with limited resources unable to access services from a trained doula. Volunteer birth companion programs are one model for increasing access to continuous labor support by bringing the community into the hospital. This article describes a birth justice-focused volunteer birth companion program that evolved out of a multistakeholder collaboration between community birth workers, local reproductive justice organizations, and hospital-based providers, staff, and administrators in direct response to community needs. This program is unique in its collaborative development, grounding in core values, and design of a reproductive justice-focused curriculum that includes training in diversity, inclusion, and care for clients with a history of trauma or perinatal substance use. Key takeaways include recommendations to center client needs, consider sustainability, and embrace flexibility and change. Discussion includes recognition of the strengths and limitations of a volunteer-based model, including acknowledgment that volunteer birth work, while filling an important gap, necessitates the privilege of having sufficient time, economic freedom, and social support. Ensuring universal insurance coverage for doula services has the potential to increase access to continuous labor support, improve birth outcomes, and diversify the birth workforce. © 2022 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.},

Abortion as practice and rhetoric has historically drawn attention to the reproductive body in the public sphere. This book traces the continuities and discontinuities in the debates around abortion rights, and its relationship with the State, in different countries - US, Korea, China, Poland, Argentina, Ireland, India, Bangladesh, South Africa, and New Zealand. It presents a comparative analysis that is grounded thematically around issues of race, class, technology, politics, and law, through interactions with institutionalized religion and the state. Central to this endeavour is an understanding of feminist mobilization on issues of abortion rights, in different cultural-historical contexts and its implications for the articulation of reproductive justice. For instance, it looks at the specific and diverse ways in which religion and culture intersect with state practice and national identities; the emergence of social action, activism and mobilization; the international politics of population control; and the place of reproductive justice and feminist resistance in processes of democratization. Lucid and topical, this book will be of interest to students and researchers of gender studies, sociology, political science, human rights, policy around reproductive and women's rights, law, and reproductive justice. © 2023 Keertana Kannabiran Tella.},

	abstract = {Three out of four people who give birth retain excess weight at 1-year postpartum. This is concerning, as postpartum weight retention is associated with increased morbidity risk. People from racial and ethnic minority groups are disproportionately affected by postpartum weight retention; 80% of Black and 69.5% of Hispanic/Latina/o/x birthing people begin pregnancy overweight or obese compared to 55% of white, non-Hispanic birthing people. Black and Hispanic/Latina/o/x birthing people also may be more likely to experience postpartum weight retention. Investigating these risks in people from racially/ethnically diverse backgrounds may be an important way to address disparities in morbidity and mortality. This narrative review uses an intersectional approach to the investigation of U.S.-based racial and ethnic disparities in postpartum weight retention, applying both the framework of Reproductive Justice and the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework. The results illustrate the Levels and Domains of research in this field of investigation, revealing that efforts have been focused at the Level of the Individual (i.e. diet, activity). Mapping the literature to the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework reveals that gaps in research exist in areas recognized as key drivers of health and health disparities (e.g. the finding that no studies have investigated postpartum weight retention within the Healthcare System Domain). Furthermore, participant-driven insights into postpartum weight retention illuminated barriers to health behaviors encountered by birthing people. Among these insights is the need for postpartum weight retention efforts to address participants’ real-life circumstances and social settings so we may address structural factors that impact postpartum weight retention. Last, stakeholder engagement and further elucidation of the social-determinants-of-health contexts will be essential to the development of high-quality interventions. Researchers must consider how the intersections of the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework’s Levels and Domains can help to provide a route for understanding the complexities related to postpartum weight retention among minority-health and health-disparity populations. Plain Language Summary: A Review of the Literature Using the National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) Research Framework to Create a Roadmap of the Studies Investigating Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Excess Weight Retained After Pregnancy Why was this study done?: Three out of four people who give birth retain excess weight at 1-year post-pregnancy. This is concerning, as weight that is retained following pregnancy is associated with increased risk for the development of disease. People from racial and ethnic minority groups experience weight retention more frequently post-pregnancy. Black and Hispanic/Latina/o/x birthing people are more likely to begin pregnancy overweight or obese. They are also more likely to retain excess weight following pregnancy. Investigating these risks in people from racially/ethnically diverse backgrounds may be an important way to address disparities in excess weight retained post-pregnancy. What did the researchers do?: This review of the literature used a tool called the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) Research Framework to map the literature to date on racial and ethnic disparities in excess weight retained post-pregnancy. What did the researchers find?: We used the NIMHD Research Framework as a visual guide of the existing research about excess weight retained following pregnancy. Results illustrate the levels and domains at which research has been investigated. These results reveal that efforts have been focused at the individual level, with most attention given to diet and activity. Mapping the literature to the NIMHD Research Framework sheds light on gaps in the research. What do the findings mean?: Mapping the literature has revealed a need for investigations that make connections between the levels and domains of the Framework, so that we may understand underlying factors that contribute to health disparities. © The Author(s) 2023.},

The rupture includes reproductive issues to care for posthuman dignity. In this work, I want to outline questions of trans and reproductive posthumanism interested in surrogacy in its different modalities. Gestational surrogacy is relevant to redirect reproduction following criteria that enhance individual choice. I begin by underlining the liberal heritage in the social movement for human enhancement and procreative choice. Next, I suggest that surrogacy could be considered as likely posthuman reproduction by drawing on gender studies and the permissiveness of commercial sex. Thus, the reproductive posthumanist goals envision an agenda different from the feminist one. Posthuman and feminist perspectives propose horizons of reproductive justice that will need to be critiqued in context before nation-states proceed with reforms. © 2022 Universitat de Barcelona, Observatorio de Bioetica y Derecho.

The same month, Together for Yes – the national civil society campaign advocating for a ‘Yes’ vote in the referendum – was launched. This article draws upon findings from 27 in-depth interviews conducted in December 2019 and January 2020 with Irish abortion activists, to explore the moral and emotional construction of abortion within the ‘Yes’ campaign. This research suggests that the ‘Yes’ campaign, which secured 66% of the votes cast in the referendum, framed abortion as a negative affective object and constructed the moral permissibility of abortion along rather conservative lines. Data from the first year of abortion provision in the Republic of Ireland reveals that abortion seekers still face huge obstacles in accessing services in the State. The legislation introduced in January 2019 allows abortion on request only until 12 weeks, whilst issues remain in relation to the refusal of care. This article, therefore, concludes that by framing abortion in conservative terms, the pro-choice campaign has not yet succeeded in destigmatising abortion in Ireland – an issue now translated into limited legislation and inadequate provision of services. © The Author(s) 2021.},

	abstract = {June 24th, 2022, a day that will be etched in today and future generations’ textbooks as a historic day, the United States of America revoked the constitutional right to seek safe abortion care. Overturning Roe v Wade allowed the divided individual states to independently decide the legal parameters regarding abortion care. A decision that disproportionately effects the reproductive lives of women residing on the land of America. Given the systemic impacts of racism, neoliberalism and white supremacy, it is the Black, racialized and poor women who suffer terrible repercussions. In this commentary the authors begin by discussing the historical biopolitical perspective, colonial systems and longstanding impacts on racialized women’s bodies in America. The discussion transitions to the implications of geopolitics at play nationally and cascading impacts globally, focusing on humanitarian and emergency settings. Using a medical humanities perspective, authors highlight the collision between politics and reproductive health policy and its implications on social determinants of health, such as women’s education, employment, housing, racial and gender equity and wellbeing. Long standing advocates, community leaders and healers, leading scientists, birth attendants, doctors, nurses, allied health professionals/providers and humanitarian workers – and many others - are reminded and live the weight of the continuous battle of population control, stemming from the oppressive history of control and exploitation. © 2022, The Author(s).},

However, the experiences of state-recognized tribes, which do not receive healthcare through the Indian Health Service (IHS), have received less attention. The objective of this study was to explore the birth control access experiences and barriers among Indigenous women belonging to a state-recognized tribe in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. In partnership with a community advisory board, a qualitative descriptive research approach was used to conduct semi-structured life course interviews with 31 Indigenous women. Themes related to birth control included: What Form of Birth Control Used; Lack of Communication With Doctor About Birth Control, with the subtheme: Lack of Communication About Side Effects of Birth Control; Limited Access to Birth Control; and Beliefs and Values About Birth Control. Through exploring the unique ways women who are members of a state-recognized tribe access and use birth control, this research begins to fill an important gap in reproductive justice literature. These findings indicate that important reproductive justice components related to birth control access and holistic, culturally-informed provider-interactions are currently lacking for members in this tribe. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Such evidence might help address the lack of support and information that many Black women report in patient–provider encounters, and broaden empirical knowledge on the contextual factors that influence Black women’s reproductive decisions. In the present qualitative study, we explored Black women’s pathways to motherhood within a reproductive justice framework. We drew on individual, semi-structured interview data from 31 Black mothers (25–50 years, Mage = 35 years) across the United States. Using consensual qualitative research methods, we elaborated on three themes: (1) intentional family planning, (2) unintended pregnancy, and (3) othermothering. The findings challenge deficit-based stereotypes of Black mothers’ reproductive choices and illuminate how health practitioners can facilitate humanizing conversations that prioritize Black women’s family planning goals and decision-making. © The Author(s) 2022.},

Aptly termed the Feminist Agenda for a Green New Deal, this evolving policy platform and ecofeminist manifesto provide innovative and cross-cutting perspectives on how policymakers, activist organizations, and civil society should plan for greener, regenerative, and care-fueled futures for all. The following chapter outlines and examines the Feminist Agenda for a Green New Deal principles for tensions and congruences, as well as analyzes opportunities and challenges for coalition building and communicating across epistemic divides. As a co-founding and steering committee member of the Feminist Agenda for a Green New Deal, I argue that economic, environmental, and social policies that fail to center climate and COVID recovery solutions devised by feminists and BIPOC communities will continue to exacerbate global inequality, as well as the rights of nature and human rights abuses. Policy approaches that lack considerations of gender and reproductive justice will likewise consolidate white supremacist, fascist, neocolonial, and patriarchal power across geopolitical borders. To manifest the liberatory vision(s) of the Feminist Agenda for a Green New Deal, I believe that feminist policy advocates and educators must utilize communication strategies that appeal to more diverse and less insular audiences (including politically conservative audiences and technocratic policymakers), rethink multilateralism, and nurture collective action guided by healing justice and feminist fellowship. Irrespective of these challenges, the Feminist Agenda for a Green New Deal offers a unique opportunity to increase global awareness of the linkages between neoliberal policy solutions and the institutionalization of gendered and racialized environmental violence, while transforming the decolonial contours and futurist imaginings of global environmental governance. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Kyla Tienhaara and Joanna Robinson; individual chapters, the contributors.},

Drawing on traditions of philosophical and sociological thinking, it presents the case for recognizing autonomy in personal, private decision-making about reproductive intentions. Further, it argues that to prevent a woman making this decision according to her own values is to undermine the essence of her humanity. The author explores how true respect for human life and regard for individual conscience demands that we support a woman’s right to decide, and that support for her right to terminate her pregnancy has moral foundations and ethical integrity. This second edition features a foreword by US abortion provider and reproductive justice advocate Dr. Willie Parker, as well as additional chapters that consider the rights of doctors and nurses to withdraw from abortion provision on grounds of conscience. Furedi also surveys the rapidly changing landscape of the abortion debate, including the rights of women in the aftermath of Trump's presidency; debates, politics and religion in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland; and the differing levels of provision across Europe. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

	abstract = {For the past 50 years, abortion opponents have fought for the power to ban abortion without little attention to how things might change when they won. The battle to make abortion illegal has been predicated on three nebulous assumptions about how abortion bans work. First, supporters believe banning abortion will deter it. Second, they hope bans will send a message about abortion - specifically, that abortion is immoral. And third, they expect bans to be competently implemented and enforced. Drawing on empirical work from within and outside of the U.S., this Article offers an evidence-based assessment of each of these assumptions. Part One examines the question of deterrence by exploring findings from countries with relatively high and relatively low abortion rates. After explaining why restrictive abortion laws alone do not reduce aggregate abortion rates, I consider the matter of individual deterrence. By identifying those most likely to be deterred by U.S. abortion bans, I illustrate how abortion bans intersect with structural inequalities to disproportionately impact poor women of color and their children. Part Two tests the idea that abortion bans send a message. I consider the bans' meaning in context with U.S. laws and policies affecting families, exposing the difference between laws discouraging abortion, and those encouraging childbirth. Then, drawing from literature on the expressive function of the law, I assess the limits on the message-sending capacity of abortion bans in a society divided over abortion and over its commitment to children living in poverty. Part Three turns to the expectation that abortion bans will be competently enforced, noting the legitimacy struggles arising from law enforcement patterns, along with the administrative challenges inherent in overseeing the various exceptions to abortion bans. This article concludes by considering why the consequences and limitations of abortion bans should matter to supporters and opponents, alike.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

	abstract = {Introduction: Reproductive injustices such as forced sterilization, preventable maternal morbidity and mortality, restricted access to family planning services, and policy-driven environmental violence undermine reproductive autonomy and health outcomes, with disproportionate impact on historically marginalized communities. However, curricula focused on reproductive justice (RJ) are lacking in medical education. Methods: We designed a novel, interactive, case-based RJ curriculum for postclerkship medical students. This curriculum was created using published guidelines on best practices for incorporating RJ in medical education. The session included a prerecorded video on the history of RJ, an article, and four interactive cases. Students engaged in a 2-hour small-group session, discussing key learning points of each case. We evaluated the curriculum's impact with a pre- and postsurvey and focus group. Results: Sixty-eight students participated in this RJ curriculum in October 2020 and March 2021. Forty-one percent of them completed the presurvey, and 46% completed the postsurvey. Twenty-two percent completed both surveys. Ninety percent of respondents agreed that RJ was relevant to their future practice, and 87% agreed that participating in this session would impact their clinical practice. Most respondents (81%) agreed that more RJ content is needed. Focus group participants appreciated the case-based, interactive format and the intersectionality within the cases. Discussion: This interactive curriculum is an innovative and effective way to teach medical students about RJ and its relevance to clinical practice. Walking alongside patients as they accessed reproductive health care in a case-based curriculum improved students' comfort and self-reported knowledge on several RJ topics. © 2022 Ojo et al.},

	abstract = {With the enactment of the Abortion Legislation Act 2020, New Zealand radically transformed its approach to abortion. Abortion is no longer a crime, and is instead regulated under general health law, adopting a gestational model. Whilst some claim that reform was overdue, critics have described the new legislation as the 'world's most extreme abortion law'. This article investigates these claims through the lens of reproductive justice, a movement that emerged alongside the global campaign for recognition of reproductive rights. First, it outlines the tenets of reproductive justice, before critiquing New Zealand's previous law, and considering arguments for its modernisation. It then describes how a growing number of jurisdictions have decriminalised abortion, with increasing pressure on other countries, including England and Wales, to similarly undertake law reform. Finally, it examines the main provisions of New Zealand's law. It concludes that, to the extent that the new law enables access to timely, equitable, and publicly funded abortion services, it is consistent with the tenets of reproductive justice. By placing women at the centre of the law, it improves the welfare of women, but particularly marginalised women. However, it suggests that the current 20-week gestational test is arbitrary, with the originally proposed 22-week threshold preferable.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

	abstract = {Access to publicly funded fertility care in Aotearoa New Zealand is determined by clinical priority access criteria (CPAC). The CPAC for infertility is designed to ration public access to treatment based on those most likely to benefit. Included in the criteria is the requirement that the body mass index (BMI) of the person seeking fertility care be within the range of 18–32 kg/m2 automatically excluding fat people without regard to their broader health and infertility context nor to variations in mean BMI amongst different ethnic groups. This chapter presents a critical discussion about the implications of the CPAC drawing on affective-discursive analysis of qualitative interviews with six ethnically diverse women who were unable to access fertility care because of their size. Key themes are explored including challenging the conflation of fatness with poor maternal health; fat shame and stigma and its effects; and the broader gendered, raced, and classed implications of the CPAC in terms of who can access assisted reproductive technologies and form families. We conclude by drawing on the principles of reproductive justice to insist on assisted reproductive technology policy (and funding) that decolonises assisted reproductive technologies and is fair, just, and inclusive. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: Black infants die three times as often as white and Hispanic infants before their first birthday in Milwaukee, WI. Prematurity is the major cause of infant mortality, and social determinants of health contribute to this disparity. Objectives: To understand how socioeconomic factors and racism create barriers to healthy pregnancies and birth outcomes for Black women, and identify practices necessary for overcoming these barriers. Methods: Thirteen collaborators (four women, four support group leaders, and five health professionals) were recruited from church support groups, a family medicine residency clinic, and the health department. Data were collected through field observations, six one-on-one interviews, one small group interview, and one focus group. Results: Thematic analysis identified six key themes related to socioeconomic factors and racism in women’s and infant health: Public Apathy; Violence and Stress; Discrimination; Mistrust; Spiritual and Social Support; Reproductive Justice. Conclusions for Practice: These themes point out failures in health care, social services, and policy initiatives that do not meet women’s and infant needs, in addition to some opportunities to implement successful practices. Recommendations are made for policymakers, social services, health systems, and health professionals to implement systemic changes that support Black women and their families. Future applications of this work include implementing and measuring the impact of systems change to benefit Black women and families. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The Nordic welfare state aims to offer universal healthcare and achieve good health, bar none. We discuss past and present moral blind spots in welfare state bioethics through reproductive justice and queer bioethics, particularly focusing on race and racism, based on ethnographic data from Finland. Globally portrayed as aspirational and mostly uninterrogated, it is crucial to have a thorough bioethical evaluation of a Nordic model informed by Black and queer perspectives. We have come to conceptualize the Finnish welfare state as haunted. We fear that the seemingly non-racial racial hygiene continues to haunt bioethics of the welfare state as structural racism. A key cause for this concern is the lack of racial awareness in public politics and the reluctance in discussing racism due to the national agenda of color-blindness. This crucially compounds to our findings that medical professionals prefer to think they operate on “purely medical” reasoning as opposed to nuanced ethical contemplation, the latter associated with “social issues” that allegedly cannot be resolved and are outside medical interest. We discuss how the bioethical aftermath of eugenics remains unresolved. Racist, classist, sexist, ableist, and cis- and heteronormative stratification of reproduction requires a nuanced moral compass for Nordic welfare state bioethics, not “strictly medical practice.” We suggest queer bioethics as a moral theory for recalibrating this compass, joining forces with other justice movements to tackle racism in healthcare and further to interrogate racism, sexism, ableism and cis- and heteronormativity in bioethics. © 2021 The Authors.

Through this mash-up of analysis and dialogue, we consider two texts that are disparate in their focus, form, and historical situatedness but that have both garnered considerable public uptake. We find in both works provocative possibilities for centering and taking seriously young people as sexual beings, troubling problematic and differential notions of sexual innocence, and exploring thorny topics such as consent. Our personal reflections and experiences contribute to this analysis as we imagine how artists, teachers, and activists (and those who hold more than one of these roles at once) can cultivate more public engagements around topics of sexuality and desire in ways inspired by these texts and aligned with reproductive justice goals of human rights, safety, and dignity for all. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

	abstract = {Healthcare systems in many southern African countries have historically failed to meet public demands, leading to a system stratified along class, gender and racial lines. The poor, often bearing the brunt of mass unemployment, not only rely on a failing system, but resort to parallel systems. Building on theoretical and political standpoints that emerge as feminist scholars interrogate and engage with the body, this chapter explores notions of reproductive violence and stratified access to reproductive health. It argues that southern African countries domesticate international policies governing reproductive health in a way that perpetuates reproductive violence, defined here as the institutional or structural, physical, and emotional violence that women suffer in attempting to access pregnancy termination services. Through domestication, the international policies emerge as ‘soft law’, not binding on governments. The way poor migrant and South African women are lured by illegal adverts to put themselves at risk of maternal death or longstanding reproductive health complications – in a country celebrated for its progressive constitutional position on termination – opens space for conceptual and empirical interrogations. The chapter argues that illegal services illuminate the realities of institutional reproductive violence that stem from limited and inaccessible public healthcare services. It further exposes the realities of transnational care evident in the huge influx of regional migrants to South Africa in search of reproductive justice. It concludes with a discussion calling for decolonised and reformed healthcare systems that speak to contextual specificities and necessities in southern Africa. © Manchester University Press 2022.},

	abstract = {Situating Annie Ernaux’s L’évènement and Cristian Mungiu’s 4 Months, 3 Weeks, and 2 Days in a reproductive justice framework, I argue that both the memoir and the film contribute to working-class historiographies by documenting backstreet abortion in times and places where it was heavily criminalized: 1960s France and Communist Romania. Committed to a working-class aesthetic with roots in neorealism, Ernaux and Mungiu focus singularly on an event once deemed unrepresentable in literature and cinema. Drawing upon the distinction made between empathy and “rational compassion” made by Paul Bloom in Against Empathy (2016), as well as from Kelly Oliver’s Witnessing: Beyond Recognition (2001), I contend that Ernaux’s memoir and Mungiu’s film call upon us to have compassion but not empathy for their protagonists, university students from working-class backgrounds who were denied the range of reproductive options afforded to more privileged women. Through metatextual commentary and carefully orchestrated camerawork, respectively, Ernaux and Mungiu decenter their narrative subjects, confronting us with emotions and experiences with which we cannot identify. At the same time, they underscore the need for solidarity between female outlaws through their portrayal of backstreet abortion as a feminist quest, revising Joseph Campbell’s male-centered monomyth. Their works transcend a pro-choice/pro-life position and remind us of our ethical imperative to bear witness to marginalized women’s histories. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

	abstract = {Reproductive justice is a holistic human-rights framework encompassing the right not to parent, to parent, and the conditions impacting those choices. It recognizes the insufficiency of previous “choice” models which ignore the intersectional forces constraining access, and highlights the role of institutions, governments, and communities in ensuring justice. Founded by US women of color, reproductive justice has been taken up around the world as a productive way to highlight the forces of race, class, ability, environment, and sexuality on reproduction while demanding change. This handbook examines the representation of reproductive justice issues, including birth justice, abortion, assisted reproductive technologies, surrogacy, adoption, and parenting, in literature and film. These narratives form an archive of global reproductive justice issues as they manifest in cultural production, including novels, stories, memoirs, drama, film, and YouTube videos. Whether in speculative dystopias or realistic depictions, fictional characters expose issues unfamiliar to some, creating empathy and seeds of activism, while confirming the experience of injustice for others. Memoir, nonfiction, and documentary further record and illuminate the need for reproductive justice. These original chapters draw from a range of disciplinary perspectives to demonstrate the significant role of reproductive justice in literature and film. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

There is no dearth of information in the academic databases, yet little progress has been made in stopping the harm being done by unnecessary medical procedures such as Caesarian sections (World Health Organization, 2021). Since Smokey the Bear was introduced, the concept of humanizing topics by putting faces and voices on social issues is recognized as psychologically effective (Herbert, W. 2013), and that is what the documentary “Birth-Time” does. It gives voices to the words on paper found in our databases. The video offers first-person stories through interviews of women and their partners who felt traumatized by their birth experiences as well as confirming testimony from experts in the field. It offers important insights into the problems inherent in our medical systems that lead to women feeling traumatized and often suffering from postpartum depression or PTSD after the birth of a child, the helpless feelings experienced by partners and fathers who feel left out of the birth experience, an understanding of how denial of culture affects minority women, and also why those in the medical fields often feel compelled to work in a system they themselves do not support. What is unique is that in addition to identifying the problem, the documentary offers ideas for solutions. © 2022. All Rights Reserved.},

We show how Kawakami’s Breasts and Eggs (Natsu monogatari, 2019) and Murata’s Vanishing World (Shōmetsu sekai, 2015) engage with government discourses and political pressures in distinct ways and yet share the same feminist motivation to challenge oppressive structures and reclaim reproductive justice. Through the life stories presented through various women, Breasts and Eggs engages with actual debates on reproductive ethics and complicates the protagonist’s own decision to embrace reproductive alternatives. Vanishing World envisions a future society in which sex, gender, and the idea of a nuclear family gradually vanish from the world, challenging ideas of heteronormative reproduction. Both writers’ works share a concern for the precarious position of women today, and they reimagine, from a feminist perspective, an alternative reality that is not a repetition of the past, but instead, offer hope for a future that is in conversation with the past and present. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

This conservative pietist movement is known, among other things, for its birth control ban, which extends not only to artificial contraception but also to fertility awareness methods and, in its most extreme form, even to marital celibacy. This article argues that “continuous traumatic stress” (cts)—a term that, unlike post-traumatic stress, focuses on chronic, ongoing trauma—and “religious trauma” together constitute a relevant conceptual lens through which to examine Rauhala’s depiction of the life of her female protagonist under the Conservative Laestadian birth control ban, a prohibition operating in the realm of religious regulation of both body and mind. More generally, this article posits that examinations of gendered and gender-specific traumas resulting from “destructive uses of religion” (psychiatrist James L. Griffith’s term; italics added) are an integral part of the interdisciplinary study of religion and gender. © KONINKLIJKE BRILL NV, LEIDEN, 2022.},

	abstract = {The fragility of reproductive rights in the United States has never been so clear. From the Supreme Court’s recent Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade, to a quickly growing number of states passing draconian state laws that drastically limit—and in some states, ban—access to safe and legal abortion care, reproductive freedom is under siege at every turn. This difficult reality has elevated the importance of reproductive rights to the forefront of many people’s consciousness. At the same time, the discourse concerning reproductive rights has been narrowly focused and has failed to recognize the scope of reproductive decisionmaking beyond abortion. In addition, the reproductive rights movement has traditionally overlooked the myriad other ways in which marginalized populations, including people with disabilities, experience reproductive oppression. This Article responds to the contemporary besiege on reproductive freedom and the persistent reproductive oppression experienced by people with disabilities by proposing a vision to help activists, legal professionals, scholars, and policymakers conceive of and articulate the basic contours of a paradigm shift that supports the coalescence of the disability justice and reproductive justice movements. To do so, first the Article examines the origins of weaponizing sexuality and reproduction to subjugate disabled people in the United States. Drawing on legal scholarship and social science research, it then elucidates the scope of the problem by describing the social context and institutions that propagate the sexual and reproductive oppression of people with disabilities and highlights contemporary examples of such injustices. Thereafter, the Article introduces and explores the tenets of two complementary frameworks for analyzing and confronting the reproductive oppression of people with disabilities: disability justice and reproductive justice. Finally, guided by the tenets of disability justice and reproductive justice, it further develops a jurisprudential and legislative framework for achieving and delivering reproductive justice for people with disabilities. © 2022 University of Pennsylvania Law School.

	abstract = {This chapter examines British social realist cinema as a site of critical engagement with domestic welfare policy regimes, analyzing how representations of the intimate lives of vulnerable white working-class families—and single mothers in particular—are used to drive socialist polemics on the failings of the welfare state. This chapter begins by setting out a relationship between reproductive justice theory and the British welfare state. It first discusses the ways in which the founding principles of the post-war settlement (equitable access to housing, healthcare, education, and protections against poverty) represent potentially positive opportunities for the progression of reproductive justice, before examining the gradual dismantling of the welfare state in the late twentieth century and the damaging effects of post-2008 austerity policies on low-income families and single mothers. This chapter then turns to the work of preeminent British social realist filmmaker Ken Loach, focusing on two of his most publicly impactful UK-based works, (Cathy Come Home. 1966. Directed by Ken Loach. The Wednesday Play Series. BBC.) and I, Daniel Blake (2016), to explore their use of white working-class mother figures to corporealize direct critiques of contemporaneous welfare policymaking. The aims of this discussion are firstly to use an RJ framework to examine Loach’s social realist storytelling as a form of emotive critique of the dismantling of humanist resources for safe and dignified parenting, in which vulnerable white maternal bodies are specially mobilized to generate pathos, and secondly to critically evaluate the terms of these mobilizations, questioning the extent to which paternalistic, disempowering, or universalizing approaches are taken toward mothering women. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

Such tropes uphold conservative anxieties around reproductive technologies, abortion, and pregnancy, and these works thus become influential in legal, ethical, and policy discussions on these issues. In contrast, feminist science fiction attempts to expose reproductive injustice, both current and future, through portrayals of prototype social-legal contexts. In this article, I argue that feminist science fiction works are, therefore, of importance for feminist legal theory as they can help us imagine a radically transformed future for reproduction. I consider the work of Octavia Butler and Laura Lam as examples of reproductive dystopia highlighting current, past, and potential future socio-legal injustices. These feminist works call for change grounded in the lived experiences of women and people capable of becoming pregnant.  © The Author/s 2022.},

	abstract = {Reproductive justice contextualizes an individual’s ability to control their reproductive destiny within the conditions of their lives, including how and what they learn about pregnancy. Yet in the US, mainstream self-help pregnancy literature is rooted in the (bio)medicalization of pregnancy which considers the prenatal period as a disease state in need of medical management by “experts.” Pregnancy manuals present readers with standardized and universal directives about how to perform pregnancy, encourage individuals to heed the advice of experts, utilize technology to “know” their own bodies and fetus, and engage in self-surveillance to mitigate pregnancy risks to the fetus/baby, who is to be protected at all costs, including the erosion of bodily autonomy. Pregnancy manuals are geared to privileged women and direct them to perform pregnancy in a disembodied way to maximize the likelihood of ideal outcomes: healthy babies. In this way, pregnancy self-help literature disembodies pregnant individuals, and their one-size-fits-all advice erases the sociopolitical, economic, and historical context that RJ emphasizes as critical to health and reproductive freedom. These texts reduce pregnant individuals to reproductive vessels, frame pregnancy as a health project, and posit the (re)production of a healthy baby as a social and moral responsibility akin to eugenic thinking. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been an increase in women obtaining donor sperm via unregulated websites and social media. In this article, we bring together the disparate evidence in this emerging field to consider whether restrictive UK policies and practices for regulated clinical donor insemination (DI) are a potential explanation for the growing use of the currently unregulated, online route to donor insemination. To this end, we examine the nature of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, recent data provided by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), and prior research on who uses online sperm donation and their reasons for doing so. In addition, we highlight why this issue is important by outlining some of the benefits and drawbacks of the unregulated route. We argue that, whilst there are many factors driving the unregulated route to DI, restrictive UK policies and practices for regulated DI might be one of these. We conclude that turning our attention to structural barriers, such as regulated DI policies and practices, is necessary to produce more definitive evidence of this potential issue, and that adopting a Reproductive Justice framework could lead to more equitable provision of regulated DI services.

	abstract = {A growing body of scholarship argues that by disentangling gestation from the body, artificial wombs will alter the relationship between men, women, and fetuses such that reproduction is effectively ‘degendered’. Scholars have claimed that this purported ‘degendering’ of gestation will subsequently create greater equity between men and women. I argue that, contrary to the assumptions made in this literature, it is law, not biology, that acts as a primary barrier to the ‘degendering’ of gestation. With reference to contemporary case law involving disputes over frozen embryos, I demonstrate that though reproductive technologies have already made it possible for gendered progenitors to have an ‘equal’ say in gestation, law mires the possibilities of these technologies in traditional stories of gendered parenthood. Looking to the way binary assumptions about gender limit the self-determination of trans men and nonbinary and genderqueer people who are gestational parents, I argue the ‘degendering’ of gestation will come not with artificial wombs but with the end of limited legal paradigms for gendered gestational parenthood. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Dystopias—societies organized around deep inequalities—have existed in the context of Atlantic Canada since colonization. In this article, we seek to center the concept of dystopia as an important sphere of inquiry through participatory visual research with six 2SLGBTQ+ young people (14–17) in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada. Using an intersectional lens (Crenshaw, 1989), we consider how intersecting power structures—gender, race, class, and disability—produce unequal impacts in relation to social and reproductive justice issues in Atlantic Canadian contexts. In this paper, we highlight DIY media-making—as a multiliteracy practice—with 2SLGBTQ+ youth to explore social and reproductive justice. As early as 1994, Julian Sefton-Green and David Buckingham wrote about the importance of acknowledging the situated nature of people’s local literacy practices and of examining the ways that people make meaning through multiple texts in order to instigate social change. Other scholars working within a multiliteracy framework (see, e.g., Barton and Hamilton, Literacy practices. In Barton D, Hamilton M, Ivanic R (eds) Situated literacies: theorizing reading and writing in context. Routledge, pp 25–32, 2005; Rowsell J and Pahl, The Routledge handbook of literacy studies. Routledge, 2015) argue that an understanding of multiliteracies includes modes of processing, producing, analyzing, and meaning-making. Centering 2SLGBTQ+ youth agency, we position DIY media-making as a multiliteracy practice through stencil production and drawing. Through a close reading of three youth-produced images, and an interdisciplinary inquiry into dystopias present and future, we seek to make visual an ethical place of belonging among the dystopic. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Sexual violence and relationship abuse are prevalent among adolescents and programs promoting gender equity, reproductive justice, and healthy relationships are key strategies for prevention. While such “gender transformative” approaches appear promising for boys, they have not been evaluated among girls. This study assessed the feasibility of this community-based program, called Sisterhood 2.0, among girls in socially disadvantaged urban neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Methods: This quasi-experimental trial examined feasibility of Sisterhood 2.0 (n = 246), delivered through 8 weekly sessions, assessed through attendance, retention and satisfaction. Participants completed surveys at baseline and end of program assessing other relevant measures. Generalized linear mixed models estimated changes from baseline to follow up comparing intervention to control participants. Results: Eleven neighborhoods were assigned to Sisterhood 2.0 (n = 5 neighborhoods) or job-readiness training (n = 6 neighborhoods). Girls were between the ages of 13 and 19, 8–10th graders (59%), and self-identified as Black (69%). Participants most often attended because they thought the program would be interesting (74%) and returned because of the women teaching the program (71%). Girls reported experiences with physical adolescent relationship abuse (ARA) (30% in both arms), emotional ARA (66% intervention; 56% control), or sexual ARA (11% intervention; 12% control). Physical ARA perpetration was high in both arms (intervention: 47%; control: 46%). Significant intervention effects were observed in recognition of abuse (β = 0.41, 95% confidence interval 0.03–0.78). No other significant intervention effects were observed. Conclusions: Community-based gender-transformative programming for girls is feasible and may be a promising approach for addressing interpersonal violence and promoting sexual health. © 2022 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.},

Writers like Sarah Orne Jewett, Edith Summers Kelley, Jamaica Kincaid, Toni Morrison, and Kali Fajardo-Anstine include abortifacients in their fiction, sometimes by name and sometimes by suggestion. The tension between implication and cultivated ignorance exposes the potential for circulating knowledge against the limits of a reader or publisher’s potential ignorance of herbal abortion. Herbal abortion exists outside of the bounds of medical institutions that have troubled records with respect to the treatment of pregnant people, particularly pregnant people of color. By virtue of being an alternative method of reproductive care, herbal abortion via abortifacients offers one vision of reproductive justice. This overview of key depictions of herbal abortifacients in American fiction grapples with the legacies of colonialism apparent in the circulation and commodification of botanical knowledge, as those subject to colonization have stewarded knowledges and cultivated the ignorance of those enacting colonization, occasionally keeping choice secrets to protect the privacy of their reproductive and botanical knowledge. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

As a novelist of the “black experience” (as the New York Times obituary named her—although others would argue that this racialization is limiting), Morrison’s work offers a useful lens through which to examine reproductive justice. Interpreting her novels as cultural productions engaged with material concerns illuminates the inextricability of reproduction to any vision of a just society. Morrison’s invocation of America centers the experience of Black women and girls; her work lays bare the crucial need for a reframed approach recognizing that legal rights are not enough if economic, racial, and other conditions deny equitable access. The prevalence of dead mothers, abandoned children, abortions, miscarriages, and births cannot be separated from the social conditions Morrison describes from the 1670s to the 2010s. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

Introductory and advanced textbooks in bioethics focus almost entirely on issues that disproportionately affect disabled people and that centrally deal with becoming or being disabled. However, such textbooks typically omit critical philosophical reflection on disability. Directly addressing this omission, this volume includes 36 chapters, most appearing here for the first time, that cover key areas pertaining to disability bioethics, such as: • state-of-the-field analyses of modern medicine, bioethics, and disability theory • health, disease, and the philosophy of medicine • issues at the edge-and end-of-life, including physician-aid-in-dying, brain death, and minimally conscious states • enhancement and biomedical technology • invisible disabilities, chronic pain, and chronic illness • implicit bias and epistemic injustice in health care • disability, quality of life, and well-being • race, disability, and healthcare justice • connections between disability theory and aging, trans, and fat studies • prenatal testing, abortion, and reproductive justice. The Disability Bioethics Reader, unlike traditional bioethics textbooks, also engages with decades of empirical and theoretical scholarship in disability studies-scholarship that spans the social sciences and humanities-and gives serious consideration to the history of disability activism. © 2022 Taylor and Francis.},

Wade. Reproductive justice (RJ) community-based organisation (CBO) SisterLove led a study on Black and Latinx women’s MA perceptions and experiences in Georgia. From April 2019 to December 2020, we conducted key informant interviews with 20 abortion providers and CBO leaders and 32 in-depth interviews and 6 focus groups (n = 30) with Black and Latinx women. We analysed data thematically using a team-based, iterative approach of coding, memo-ing, and discussion. Participants described multilevel barriers to and strategies for MA access, wishing that “the process had a bit more humanity … [it] should be more holistic.” Barriers included (1) sociocultural factors (intersectional oppression, intersectional stigma, and medical experimentation); (2) national and state policies; (3) clinic- and provider-related factors (lack of diverse clinic staff, long waiting times); and (4) individual-level factors (lack of knowledge and social support). Suggested solutions included (1) social media campaigns and story-sharing; (2) RJ-based policy advocacy; (3) diversifying clinic staff, offering flexible scheduling and fees, community integration of abortion, and RJ abortion funds; and (4) social support (including abortion doulas) and comprehensive sex education. Findings suggest that equitable MA access for Black and Latinx communities in the post-Roe era will require multi-level intervention, informed by community-led evidence production; holistic, de-medicalised, and human rights-based care models; and intersectional RJ policy advocacy. © 2022 The Author(s).

In Karawynn Long’s piece of science fiction, “Of Silence and Slow Time” (1995), the government determines who is “defective” and “must be exterminated” through genetic intervention. This short story’s protagonist, Marina, is a Deaf woman who desires a deaf baby and works to covertly conceive one. In this dystopia, no deaf baby has been born in twenty-five years, illustrating how deaf communities lack the ability to determine their reproductive destiny, or the right to have a child like them. With the convergence of master narratives, legislation, and the development of CRISPR technology, Long’s dystopia portended the human rights and social justice issues facing Deaf peoples. Sheena McFeely’s life-writings manifest these issues as her family discusses CRISPR in relation to the endangerment of deaf communities. We present Long’s story as a counter-narrative that presaged our current realities while illustrating interlocking systems of oppression that prevent both reproductive and disability justice—examining how science fiction writers, bioethicists, policymakers, health care providers, and Deaf peoples have attempted to address this question about the value of our lives. Ultimately, we argue that reproductive justice is incomplete without disability justice and deaf peoples’ right to be born. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

Unlike most mainstream novels and television shows that have helped normalize paid reproductive work, these detective novels, by casting surrogacy as potential crimes, raise urgent ethical and moral questions about the power imbalance between those who commission and those who undertake the labor of marketized reproduction. The novels’ criticism of surrogacy should be seen as part and parcel of a larger critique of domestic and familial ideologies which gives rise to “baby hunger”—a desperation to have genetically related children as the only acceptable basis for family-making. The novels not only draw attention to legal, emotional, and financial consequences of commercial surrogacy, they show how the pursuit of the socially endorsed desire to have “one’s own children” under structurally unequal conditions can lead to violence. Mainstream popular culture represents the contract to deliver particular goods and services (sex, babies, or body parts), too often made under duress of debt and desperation, as “choice.” By contrast, the detective novels by registering “choice” as an ethically murky, even coerced act, allow us to interrogate paid reproductive work in terms of reproductive justice. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

From the notable 1986 Baby M case in New Jersey to the recent incident of the 2008 Baby Manji case in Gujarat, surrogacy has always been shrouded in controversies. Despite these uncertainties, medical technologies have reinforced and normalized the notion of “wombs for rent” and “baby factories,” transforming the body of Third World women into an active site of reproductive exploitation and providing a rationale for the creation of a new kind of eugenics. This chapter argues for a reproductive justice perspective on Indian surrogacy and emphasizes its epistemic candor. It highlights how the reproductive advantages of some women are directly proportional to the reproductive disciplining of other women—perpetuating inequality. The chapter, through Meera Syal’s The House of Hidden Mothers (2015) and Amulya Malladi’s A House for Happy Mothers (2016), demonstrates the ethics of reproductive outsourcing and argues that it is an explicit manifestation of stratified reproduction. While surrogacy is believed to be separate from coercion and violence and is classed as “subjective free choice,” the chapter emphasizes the fact that surrogacy is financially motivated, raising serious issues about its autonomy. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

The past tense recognizes that prior and ongoing forms of complex white capitalist heteropatriarchal Western imperialism have left an imprint on all present-day geographies, and, as such, it urges us to interrogate the particular mechanisms by which this embedded inequity has come to be. To illuminate spatialized intersectionality and the insights into contemporary environmental, food, and reproductive (in)justices it can provide, we offer a case study of the interlocking emergence of gendered and racialized residential segregation in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. We argue that this form of spatialized intersectionality is essential to understanding how Black women became uniquely entrenched in the 53206, 53208, and 53210 zip codes that are also the most environmentally degraded and lacking of food and reproductive justice in Milwaukee County today. Through the lens of spatialized intersectionality, the reality that Black babies experienced especially severe outcomes during Milwaukee's current lead crisis can thus be understood in part as a tragic, yet predictable, intergenerational legacy of inequitable and intersecting geographic burdens. Taking this more seriously, we believe improved solutions can be addressed. In these and additional ways, we thus aim for spatialized intersectionality to unite and increase historically focused and forwardly applicable environmental scholarship.  © Copyright 2022, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

	abstract = {“Reproductive Justice,” as defined by Loretta J. Ross and Rickie Solinger (2017), includes the rights to have children and to be a parent. During the last Argentine dictatorship (1976–1983) and for a few years before, the military and its paramilitary allies decided that certain women and families should not remain together because they thought the children would become subversives like their parents. To prevent this, extra-judicial forces stole newborns and young children to “manage” the future of Argentina. The mothers were usually killed. The fictional films studied here represent visually three distinct groups of victims. The Official Story (Historia oficial, dir. Luis Puenzo, 1985) narrates the coming to consciousness of a mother who thinks she has adopted a child and later learns that her child likely had been “appropriated,” that is, removed from her biological family by force. Clandestine Childhood (Infancia clandestina, dir. Benjamín Ávila, 2011) portrays from an older child’s point-of-view the theft of his baby sister and disappearance of his parents. Third, Captive (Cautiva, dir. Gastón Biraben, 2003) represents an adolescent’s disorienting discovery that she had been taken from her biological parents to be given to allies of the regime. These widely available films share an empathy with the parents’ loss of a child and with children’s loss of biological parents, an emphasis on the importance of reproductive justice and parenting, and a resistance to the dictatorship’s narrative of silence and fear. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

Butler is deeply concerned with how hierarchies of power manifest not only socio-politically but also interpersonally. Even relationships defined by love, community, interconnectedness, and symbiosis must navigate imbalances in power that result in attempts to subject and exploit those involved. For Butler, varying relations of power and powerlessness structure every social dynamic. Butler particularly explores this theme and thesis through the relationship between humans and technology, reproducing bodies, children, and other mediating social and political entities and forces. Pregnancy and parenthood are one of the ultimate symbiotic relationships, and the conditions under which beings can choose or not choose to have or not have children not only speaks volumes about a society’s ability to repress, control, and oppress its population but also subjugated people’s ability to resist, reimagine, and remake the world. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

I maintain it was the independent (non-state funded) nature of pro-choice groups that enabled them to determine their own structures and tactics including participative, dialogic, hands-on, adult education. As the Irish reproductive rights movement enters a new phase of seeking to improve one of Europe’s most conservative laws, I argue for a reproductive justice approach that expands its demands far beyond the single issue of abortion access.

In her article, “What is Reproductive Justice? How Women of Color Activists Are Redefining the Pro-Choice Paradigm,” Kimala Price asserts, “Women must be able to freely exercise these rights without coercion. Although reproductive justice activists acknowledge that an emphasis on gaining legal rights, lobbying, and electoral politics is not necessarily a bad thing, they argue that there has to be an intersectional analysis and the acknowledgment of oppression in order for women to truly gain freedom” (2010). Since race, gender, and class are intersectional realities that generally prevent Black women from gaining the same power as White women, it is logical to assume that Black women have fewer opportunities to exert their reproductive power. This chapter will examine reproductive justice among the Black female protagonists in the 2010 Tyler Perry film adapted from Ntozake Shange’s 1975 original choreopoem “For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow is Enuf.” This work examines the characters, particular scenes from the film, the words uttered by these women, as well as the emotions that these Black women use to reveal their relationships with themselves, the individuals in their lives, and each other. This chapter will also discuss the internal and external forces that influence Black women to bear children, not bear children, and parent in precarious and nurturing environments. Reproductive justice embodies a conscious fragility and/or malleability that is largely contingent on the social support networks of Black women. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

	abstract = {Introduction: While reproductive injustice indicators are improving globally, they are worsening in the United States particularly for Black and other marginalized communities. Eugenics and obstetric violence against low-income and communities of color create well-founded distrust of sexual and reproductive health (SRH). Transformational, reparative ways of conducting SRH research are needed. Proposed principles of community-led research for reproductive justice: Drawing on our collective experience as reproductive justice leaders, SRH researchers, and clinicians, we propose the following principles of community-led research for reproductive justice: 1) Center the marginalized community members most affected by SRH inequities as leaders of research; 2) Facilitate equitable, collaborative partnership through all phases of SRH research; 3) Honor multiple ways of knowing (experiential, cultural, empirical) for knowledge justice and cross-directional learning across the team; 4) Build on strengths (not deficits) within the community; 5) Implement the tenets of reproductive justice including structural-level analysis and the human rights framework; 6) Prioritize disseminating useful findings to community members first then to other audiences; 7) Take action to address social and reproductive injustices. SisterLove's community-led georgia medication abortion project: We offer the community-led Georgia Medication Abortion (GAMA) Project by reproductive justice organization SisterLove from 2018–2022 as a case study to demonstrate these principles along with the strengths and challenges of reproductive justice research. Discussion: Community-led reproductive justice research offers innovative and transformational methods for truly advancing SRH in an era of increasing policy restrictions and decreasing access to care. Yet existing funding, research administrative, and publishing systems will require structural change.

	abstract = {Introduction: In Canada, any adult who is aware of the permanent consequences of a tubal ligation is allowed to receive it, yet many doctors refuse to perform the procedure on women, especially those from marginalized communities. The purpose of this report is to investigate and identify some of the barriers that impede Canadian women’s ability to access voluntary sterilization. There is a particular focus on how Canada's history of eugenics and coerced sterilization shapes the current conditions under which women seek and are too often refused access to permanent contraception. Methods: Six qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with scholars and activists in the field of Reproductive Justice (RJ) and reproductive healthcare. The interviews facilitated discussions about reproductive autonomy, patient rights, and patriarchal attitudes in medicine. An RJ framework and thematic analysis were used to uncover systemic barriers from the interview responses. Results: As discovered through the interviews, the most prevalent barriers to access to voluntary sterilization in contemporary Canada include race, class, language, ethnicity, disability, age and parity. An RJ framework identifies historical parallels to these present-day barriers by looking at the historical and colonial forces that disempower intersectional marginalized communities and influence their reproductive decisions today. Discussions: Canada’s eugenics attitudes from the past seep into the current barriers to access faced by women of colour, low-income women, female newcomers, women with disabilities, and young or nulliparous women. The assumption that these women are not capable of deciding the right course of action for their own bodies and thus should not be trusted by healthcare providers in making these decisions is a consistent problem in both time frames. Conclusion: The restrictions and modes of disempowerment placed on variously positioned women in the past come back in a new form that leads to those same groups being doubted and denied reproductive justice in the present. Many of the interviewees believed that increasing diversity in the medical field is necessary to help alleviate the discrepancies in how contraceptive healthcare is given. © Adan Amer. (2022).

	abstract = {Focusing on Maggie Nelson’s The Argonauts (2015), this chapter explores the value of recent queer theoretical engagement with motherhood and addresses the need for stronger connection between queer visions of motherhood and feminist theory around reproductive justice. Positioning her work of autotheory within the Prop 8 campaign to oppose marriage equality, Nelson’s The Argonauts fleshes out the need to challenge queer theory’s abandonment of queer families and their children and instead to position queer mothers and other parents as resources for more expansive and inclusive political projects to support diverse LGBTQ+ kinship formations. In this way, her book connects to the reproductive justice movement because the conservative right is using fears about sexual deviance in contrast to visions of heteronormative family structures to support policies that disenfranchise parents that do not fit into this model. Even as Nelson’s work affirms the import of renderings of queer motherhood, she does not address the kinds of challenges that many twenty-first-century queer and transgender parents face from decidedly different socio-economic classes as well as Black, Indigenous, and Latinx parents impacted by a variety of oppressive structures. Thus, her visions of queer motherhood oddly are disconnected from leading feminist theorists of reproductive justice, including Loretta Ross (2017), Rickie Solinger (2017), Dorothy Roberts (1997), Laura Briggs (2017), and others. By bringing Nelson’s text into conversation with these theorists, this chapter serves as an invitation for queer theorists to engage more fully with diverse feminist theorists of reproductive justice in order to promote coalitional political projects that address multiple issues impacting minoritized parents, their children, and their communities. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

	abstract = {Objectives: 1) To explore how racism-related stress impacts Black women’s health, pregnancy, and parenting. 2) To explore how a culturally-specific program affects the relationship between racism-related stress and Black women’s health, pregnancy, and parenting. Methods: This qualitative study uses a Black Feminist approach to center the lived experiences and perspectives of Black women. Focus groups were conducted with clients and staff of a culturally-specific program that provides perinatal care for Black families. A thematic analysis was conducted using a Reproductive Justice framework as a guide. Results: Participants consisted of 23 program clients and staff who all identified as Black women. Four themes emerged from the analysis: 1) The pervasive reach of structural racism, 2) Shared identities facilitate trust and healing, 3) Racism directly impacts mental health, and 4) Advocacy on macro and micro levels is a vital service. Conclusions for Practice: Results show the chronicity and toxicity of structural racism on Black women’s physical and mental health. The presence of overt and subtle forms of racism occur in multiple systems and require interventions on macro- and micro-levels. Culturally-specific perinatal care programs that prioritize racial concordance between providers and clients/patients are well-received and effective models of care. Black perinatal care should include culturally-specific approaches, advocacy on behalf of and alongside Black people, mental health support with attention to racism-related stress, and interrogation of implicit bias. Multipronged interventions guided by Reproductive Justice principles provide a holistic framework to address interpersonal and systemic racial oppression. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

This chapter contextualizes, synthesizes, and critically examines emergent literature regarding the ways in which the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has exacerbated and unmasked childhood racial inequality. Using a reproductive justice framework, we highlight racial inequality as impacted by the pandemic in three core childhood institutions—health, economics, and education. We argue that societal responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are stratified, thereby operating as mechanisms of eugenicide as they render “undesirable” children and youth socially obsolete and undermine routine reproductive tasks in ways that expose children of color to illness and premature death. We conclude that COVID-19 responses are a technomedical, racial capitalist project that further sorts and sediments children according to pre-established hierarchies and has profound implications for childhood inequality and children’s everyday lives. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Nazneen Khan; individual chapters, the contributors},

We argue in this chapter that traditional taxis and the gigged driving sector have more in common than they are different. Specifically, they share the presumption of unfettered access to drivers’ reproductive labor as a means for industry accumulation. We argue that professional passenger ride-for-hire driving is thus best understood through the lens of reproductive labor, and the nature of which has historically been occluded behind the masculinized bodies of drivers. We use the lens of reproductive justice to trace how the passenger ride-for-hire industry, whether taxi or gig, enacts gendered violence, both in hiding the reproductive nature of driving behind masculinized drivers and in severing the safety of drivers from the interests of passengers. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Lisa M.

	abstract = {Objective: To understand the specific ways in which champions lead efforts to obtain and sustain buy-in for immediate postpartum long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) programs. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study with 60 semistructured interviews at 3 teaching hospitals in Texas with physicians, nurses, administrators and other staff who participated in the implementation of immediate postpartum LARC. Physicians self-identified as champions and identified other champion physicians and administrators. Two researchers analyzed and coded interview transcripts for content and themes. Results: We found that champions draw on institutional knowledge and relationships to build awareness and support for immediate postpartum LARC implementation. To obtain buy-in, champions needed to demonstrate financial sustainability, engage key stakeholders from multiple departments, and obtain nurse buy-in. Champions also created buy-in by communicating goals for the service that focused on expanding reproductive autonomy, improving maternal health, and improving access to postpartum contraception. Some staff, especially nurses, identified reasons for the program that run counter to reproductive justice principles: reducing birth rates, poverty, and/or unplanned pregnancy among young women and high-parity women. Respondents at 2 hospitals noted that not all women had equitable access to immediate postpartum LARC. Conclusion: Physician and non-physician champions must secure long-term support across multiple hospital departments to successfully implement an immediate postpartum LARC program. For programs to equitably serve all women in need of postpartum contraceptive care, champions and other program leaders need to implement strategies to address access issues. They should also explicitly focus on reproductive justice principles during program introduction and training. Implications: Successfully implementing immediate postpartum long-acting reversible contraception programs requires champions with institutional networking connections, administrative and nursing support, and clearly communicated goals. Champions need to address access issues and focus on reproductive justice principles during program introduction and training to equitably serve all women in need of postpartum contraceptive care. © 2021},

	abstract = {Reproductive justice (RJ) calls for an integrated analysis, a holistic vision, and comprehensive strategies that push against structural conditions that control communities by regulating bodies, sexuality, labor, and reproduction (Ross & Solinger 2017). Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women have a maternal mortality ratio of 16.4 deaths per 100,000 Indigenous women giving birth (Clark et al 2019). Disparities in reproductive justice often persist through the erasure of lived experiences. My work examines birth stories (recounting via recorded, podcasted interview) with narrative analysis and poetic inquiry. While personal essays and spoken birth stories relay narratives as they are recalled, examining poetry (through poetic inquiry) will allow exploration of narrative in ways that can be likened to experiences of maternal/pregnant phenomenologies (i.e., intersubjectivity, multiple temporalities). Traditional Indigenous Australian poetry and storytelling often evokes Country as a reoccurring motif, intricately connected to First Nations Australian culture and cosmogeny. In this chapter, I will investigate birth stories as they relate to the First Nations Australian initiative of birthing on Country and reproductive injustices in some mainstream maternal care practices. Birthing on Country has been described as the practice of giving birth on traditional lands, or with elements of First Nations groups’ cultures, incorporated into the process. Being born on Country “connects an Aboriginal person to the land and community in a deeply cultural way and affords life-long privileges such as hunting and fishing rights, as well as lifelong responsibilities for looking after Country, both land and people” (Felton-Busch, Contemporary Nurse 33:161–162, 2009). Birthing on Country is also a maternal care service initiative, available to some birthing people in Australia. While many birthing people can exercise the choice to give birth on Country, others lack access to the hospitals, birth centers, and care providers that will uphold or facilitate the practice. This chapter will explore First Nations women’s (as the participants featured identified as women) birth stories through poetic inquiry, as they relate to birthing on Country, Indigenous women’s access thereto, and their narratives of interaction with care systems and providers. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

The purpose of this study is to examine the association between relationships to land and wellness in a study of urban Indigenous women, two-spirit, trans, and gender diverse people of reproductive age in Canada’s largest city, Toronto. Methods: Data were obtained from the cross-sectional Our Health Counts (OHC) Toronto study, which employed respondent-driven sampling methods (n = 323) and a community-directed comprehensive health assessment survey. In an exploratory analysis, we took an Indigenous reproductive justice theoretical approach to multivariable logistic regression. Results: After adjusting for covariates, there was a statistically significant positive association between relationships to the land and wellness that was estimated with good precision (OR 3.7, 95% CI 2.5–5.3). Conclusion: Our findings indicate that among urban Indigenous women, two-spirit, trans, and gender diverse people of reproductive age there is a positive association between feeling strong in their relationships to land and feeling balanced in the four domains of health (physical, spiritual, mental, and emotional). The community-based, community-directed design of OHC Toronto was congruent with a reproductive justice approach to research. Reproductive justice theories are adaptable to quantitative research on Indigenous reproductive health and can yield novel insights for supporting Indigenous wellness. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {This chapter analyzes three memoirs by women who, at some point in their lives, were undocumented in the US to discuss how undocumented migration is connected to issues of reproductive justice and how women use the life writing genre to call attention to poor women of color’s in/ability to raise their children in a safe and nurturing environment. Rosalina Rosay’s Journey of Hope, Julissa Arce’s My (Underground) American Dream, and Reyna Grande’s The Distance Between Us offer intersectional insights into why parents—and specifically mothers—leave their children behind in their countries of birth to secure their families’ financial survival and to, eventually, bring their children to the US for a better life. The memoir genre, I argue, provides these writers with a venue to humanize their guardians’ decisions and to question the idea of “choice” which undocumented migrants supposedly have in where to raise their children. Their writing functions as an effective rhetorical tool to individualize undocumented migrants and to push back against widely popularized xenophobic images of the “selfish and violent” economic migrant. In demonstrating how sexism, shadism, classism, and xenophobia affect reproductive justice, the memoirs powerfully challenge privileged conceptualizations of reproductive “choice.” © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

In the economy of China’s birth control, contraception supports bureaucratic proliferation, disabled children are sold to criminal gangs as beggars in big cities, and baby girls are sent to the Welfare Office for foreign adoption. In relation to the population problem, the writer is also concerned about environmental pollution of the corrosive Yangtze River with the construction of the Three Gorges Dam during the same period. While Chinese sturgeons are doomed to extinction, the young peasant woman in the story, her schoolteacher husband, and their daughter illegally migrate downstream from the rural hinterland in Hunan Province to a Cantonese Special Economic Zone heavily polluted with dioxins, a chemical known to cause infertility. China’s one-child policy, together with its economy and ecology, is critically examined in Ma’s extraordinary descriptions of the shocking violence of birth control practices, especially the excessive cruelty by the birth-planning authorities. The situation is further complicated by the gender issue as the reality represented in The Dark Road is stark. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

These facilities engage in purposefully manipulative and deceptive practices that spread misinformation on sexual health and abortion. CPCs have also been shown to delay access to medically legitimate prenatal and abortion care, which negatively impacts maternal health. Along with increasing anti-abortion legislation, the proliferation of CPCs paired with the closure of abortion clinics exacerbates the ongoing harmful impact these centers have on the reproductive healthcare landscape; however, despite their growing influence, there is still limited research on patients’ understanding of and experiences with CPCs. This article provides a review of academic literature on CPCs and suggests future directions for research.

On the basis of pertinent studies, this paper explores archival material on several dozen allegations of reproductive abuse in the context of clergy sexual abuse of minors in the US Catholic Church. Besides some tentative estimates of the general frequency of the phenomenon, this paper offers a distinction of three different types of reproductive abuse and an analysis of the interplay of clericalist and secular misogyny, which appears to be largely responsible for the silencing of victims as well as for the impunity of perpetrators and leads to the invisibility of this phenomenon, despite the high importance attributed to reproductive issues in the Catholic context. © 2022 by the author.

This study presents another side of the surrogacy story by including the voices of intended parents residing in India, elicited through eight in-depth interviews. We assert there is need to understand Indian intended parents' socio-spatial experiences in the presence of a changing surrogacy law in India and the socio-cultural importance of childbearing and parenthood to move towards relational reproductive justice. By recognising the relational nature of surrogacy reproduction and drawing on the concepts of ethics of care in light of power and stigma discussions, this paper demonstrates how stigma is experienced by intended parents, its effect on their reproductive journey and wellbeing, as well as how stigma hinders achieving the vision of relational reproductive justice. We suggest that, in order to make surrogacy a positive experience for the people involved in surrogacy, there is a need to address stigma and view surrogacy as a relationship. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

These medical procedures are generally ethically acceptable, but as technological capabilities expand, so does the need to address ethical considerations. The basic principles of beneficence, nonmaleficence, autonomy, and justice serve as a framework when considering the ethics of most clinical procedures. This chapter discusses considerations for the number of embryos to transfer, the use of donor gametes, how to proceed when treatment seemed futile, aneuploidy testing of embryos, as well as a discussion of the ethical cautions in newer techniques such as gene-editing. The aforementioned core principles can serve as guidance when ascertaining the ethical status of current and future reproductive technologies. In discussing the ethics of informed consent in childbearing, the chapter highlights the need to address the systematic inequalities and injustices that prevent women and birthing people from exercising true autonomy in reproductive decision making. The focus on relational care and increasing awareness of inequalities and of the rights of birthing people would help to change the landscape and move our systems away from dehumanization and medicalization and toward true informed decision making. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

As a result, Black and Brown women did not have equal protection of the laws nor unimpeded access to the courts. Therefore, they had few options for protecting themselves from harm or redressing their grievances against the state. For these reasons, I conclude that African American, Native American, and Hispanic American women who were sterilized without their knowledge or consent by doctors working for public health agencies ought to be awarded reparations by the United States Congress. Additionally, I conclude that federal prosecutors and the American Medical Association ought to bring criminal charges and professional sanctions against the doctors and healthcare workers involved. Finally, I conclude that medical professionals ought to engage in a nationwide effort to reconcile people in Black and Brown communities with the healthcare community in the United States. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

Rather, she argues that the ableist structures that inform the practice of testing and termination ought to be understood as essential to the reproductive decisions that any individuals make. © 2022 Taylor and Francis.},

	abstract = {Gestational surrogacy – carrying someone else’s baby (or babies) to term and giving birth to them – is perhaps one of the most intimate acts a human being can perform for others. However, the proliferation of commercial surrogacy has drawn concern and criticism, with many scholars arguing that it both creates and exacerbates global social and economic inequalities. Commercial surrogacy thus raises both the possibility of global intimate connection and the specter of reproductive exploitation. I therefore explore the various, shifting, and often discordant desires for intimate connection between the intending parent(s), the surrogate mother, and the resulting child(ren) in commercial surrogacy. I then examine how those intimacies intersect with commercial surrogacy’s socioeconomic inequalities. Weighing commercial surrogacy’s driving desires and intimate practices against its commercialization, I end with a reconsideration of the procreative desires and intimate practices that spur current international commercial surrogacy (ICS), urging an emphasis on reproductive justice. © The Author(s) 2021.},

As people rebuild houses and family relations, they talk about replenishing life and ‘fixing’ families by having more children. This local perspective contradicts development discourses that favour lowering fertility to achieve sustainable ‘development’. Based on 18 months of ethnographic fieldwork I explore how reproduction in Timor-Leste is now being conceived in the wake of abandonment by previous colonial regimes and new development narratives; whereas people in Maubisse count ancestral lineages connecting kin and landscape, showing how reproduction is ‘distributed’ beyond individual bodies. Whilst critical of practices of counting and calculating reproduction, I argue that pursuing reproductive justice still requires considering how people count themselves. © 2022 The Author(s).

The concept of environmental reproductive justice (ERJ), or ensuring that environmental issues do not interfere with physical or cultural reproduction, involves expanding reproductive justice to include a deeper focus on the environment, and to include the reproduction of language and culture as concerns, in addition to the reproduction of human beings. ERJ also aims to expand the framework of environmental justice to more closely consider the impact of environmental contaminants on physical and cultural reproduction. Through the example of Akwesasne, a Mohawk American Indian community located downstream from industrial sites on the New York/ Canadian border, this paper explores how the concept of ERJ can be utilized to understand the unique situation of American Indian communities who are arguing that justice necessitates going beyond equal protection. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

The article also discusses access to SRH services and comprehensive education. Practical implications and resources are offered for healthcare providers for their daily encounters with AYAs, as well as for community, institutional level, and advocacy action.

For poor women in India, “a safe and dignified context” can often be conditional, partial, or even absent, in spite of the existence of several government maternity benefit schemes to ensure positive reproductive rights. Although the stories of poor Indian mothers are often silenced, there have been some efforts by activist filmmakers to document their experiences. Anhad Films has made two YouTube documentaries, “It Takes a Village to Save a Mother’s Life” and “Janam aur Jeevan” (Birth and Life), on the reproductive experiences of poor Indian mothers in rural locations. By analyzing the documentary texts, techniques, politics, and ethics in these two documentaries, and by referencing other related YouTube videos on reproductive experiences of poor and non-poor mothers in India, this chapter aims to interrogate the gaps between the policies of the state and the lived experiences of poor mothers. The analysis deploys an interdisciplinary lens resting between a reproductive justice approach and a documentary film studies framework. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

A colleague and I co-teach a popular Georgetown University undergraduate English course, “Reading Motherhood,” and we recently launched a public-facing digital project that seeks to spark conversations about motherhood, feminism, and reproductive justice. We’ve cultivated a diverse collection of US motherhood-based fiction, film, poetry, television, and streaming texts from 1945 to the present and developed a methodological approach that has not only radically transformed our students’ perspectives but enriched their mothers’ views. In turn, those students have pushed us to rethink our own analytic frameworks as teachers, writers, and mothers. Tracing the biopolitical conditions and expectations of mothering through the second half of the twentieth century to the present, we actively decenter mainstream ideologies and representations of US motherhood as inherently White, economically privileged, heteronormative, and biogenetic. But that message doesn’t actually transmit unless we listen to our students’ ideas and concerns in their particular contexts. Drawing on student journal entries, I recreate—and interrogate—diverse classroom moments to explore both our initial blind spots and the conflicted ways that young women embrace and contest essentialist notions of the maternal body and mainstream representations of motherhood. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

Margaret Atwood calls her novel an “anti-prediction,” hoping that society will heed her warning. Globally, women have co-opted the imagery from The Handmaid’s Tale to protest increased restrictions on abortion and a woman’s right to choose. The striking imagery of Atwood’s handmaids creates a powerful atmosphere at a protest; their presence alone conveys all the information we think we need to know. I argue that we can add more information to what these protesters convey. Currently, the protests do not reach the full potential for attaining reproductive justice by only focusing on abortion restrictions. I propose expanding the paradigm of such protests to reflect a more comprehensive understanding of reproductive justice and The Handmaid’s Tale. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

	abstract = {Research on reproductive justice has mainly, but not exclusively, appeared in academic literature in the context of grassroots social justice movements and as a theoretical framework for understanding the limitations of “reproductive choice” in the absence of social justice. But how can scholars design research to explore and understand reproductive (in)justice in the real lives of women of color? How can research partnerships between university scholars and community stewards be formed and sustained? What tensions and challenges are inherent in these efforts? And how can we find more equitable ways of sharing research findings and creating change with and not on behalf of our community?

	abstract = {Telehealth, one of the newest health innovations, has been promoted as a tool to enhance access to health care services in ways that center patient needs. However, integrating telehealth within an inequitable health system undermines its potential. This perspective highlights policies and practices that foster structural inequities and names their impact on the use and acceptability of telehealth for medication abortion among specific communities of color. Communities of color have a higher prevalence of abortion use but face many barriers, including financial and geographic barriers, to abortion access. Preliminary evidence on telehealth for medication abortion shows that it is highly acceptable, accommodating of patient needs, and may allow patients to access abortion care at earlier gestational ages. However, evidence during the COVID-19 pandemic shows that utilization of telehealth is lower among communities of color. We describe how systemic barriers, including regulations on or laws banning telehealth for medication abortion, disinvestments in digital access, and restrictions on public insurance coverage, could perpetuate lower utilization of telehealth for medication abortion care among communities of color. We call for systems changes that will remove these barriers and make this health care innovation available to all who may desire it. Copyright © 2022 Thompson, Northcraft and Carrión.},

	abstract = {This chapter examines four fictional narratives of childbirth in order to put forth some reading guidelines of birthing scenes at the intersections of gender, race, sexuality, and class according to the reproductive justice framework. Studying the narratives of deliveries in Anglophone literature reflects issues about physical motherhood, power, and the perception of bodies socialized as feminine. Despite the ordinariness of birth in societies, this crucial event is seldom recounted in literature. In most cases, an ellipsis or a summary comes to conceal the process of labor. The feminine body, conceived as obscene, is currently erased or dehumanized, and women’s voices are silenced. Birthing bodies, even more when they are racialized, are made mere objects of the obstetrical Western male power and gaze. Cultural and religious representations have considerably shaped the narratives of intimate feminine bodily experiences, notably through the decorporealization of the process of childbirth, and the devaluation of the materiality of motherhood. Reproductive justice allows us to care about specific forms of social oppression in childbirth and to question maternal ambivalence toward the desire to have a child or not. Shifting from an audience’s to a participant’s point of view, from fictional narratives to autobiographical ones, from male focalization to first-hand experience, enables us to discover poetical and political reappropriations of birthing that can change our perspectives on power and maternal bodies. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

Laws, policies, and programs in Canada have systemically targeted the Indigenous mother and child as a way of trying to erase a precolonial past and ensure a failed Indigenous future. Although “more than 50% of children in foster care in Canada are Indigenous,” they “account for less than 8% of the child population” (Qaqqaq 2021) and “[i]nfant mortality among First Nations people with status is almost twice the rate of the general Canadian population” (Health Council of Canada 2011, 45). With these threats to Indigenous families and futurity in Canada, the mother takes on a unique political tenor in a growing number of theatre productions that tackle reproductive justice. Written by Nlaka’pamux and Irish playwright Tara Beagan, Dreary and Izzy dramatizes the on-going cycle of maternal loss for Indigenous women in Canada. Set in the 1970s during the naming of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and the Sixties Scoop (where Indigenous children were taken by child welfare services and adopted by white families), the play ultimately calls for a renewed maternal figure and matrilineage that does not exclude mothers based on their race, culture, age, or able-bodiedness in order to protect an Indigenous future. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

	abstract = {Background: Structural racism mediates all aspects of Black life. The medicalization of pregnancy and childbirth, and its detrimental impacts on Black birth, is well documented. The Black Lives Matter movement has elevated the national consciousness on all aspects of Black life, but significant attention has been directed toward the murder and dehumanization of Black men and boys. Black midwives, caring for Black people, using the Midwives Model of Care© which consistently demonstrates its efficacy and better outcomes for Black people, are uniquely positioned to witness the physical and psychosocial experiences of birthing Black boys in America. Methods: Between 2011 and 2013, the first author conducted interviews with 22 Black midwives to understand their perceptions of, and experiences in, predominantly white midwifery education programs and professional organizations. Convenience and snowball sampling were used. This paper investigates previously unreported and unexamined data from the original study by focusing on the witness and insight of nine midwives who provided care for Black mothers of boys during pregnancy and childbirth. Findings: The data presented three themes: It’s a Boy: On Restlessness and Complicated Uneasiness; Desensitization of Black Death; and, Physiological Impacts of Toxic Stress. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that caring for Black people must be simultaneously theorized and executed within an anti-racist, relationship-centered, reproductive justice framework. Black midwives are uniquely positioned to do this work. Greater attention, in practice and in research, is needed to investigate the birth experiences of Black mothers of boys. © 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.},

Currently, escalating threats to reproductive rights are rarely discussed in contemporary social work literature. Discomfort in the profession about addressing challenges to abortion rights exposes a lack of courage to treat abortion as essential healthcare. A case study of several abortion-focused articles and chapters reveals a strand of ambivalence about taking a progressive stance on abortion. Recent trends demonstrate that reproductive rights cannot be taken for granted. Even when law reform removes some of the barriers to safe, legal abortion, abortion stigma and anti-choice harassment remain potent threats to reproductive autonomy. A case is made for reproductive justice to be central in our drive for health equality. This requires a feminist perspective, moving away from seeing women as merely the object of the social work gaze, too often the focus of scrutiny and judgement. © Policy Press 2022},

Themes were developed from participant accounts that highlight how racism, both structural and individual, influenced their reproductive health care access, utilization, and experience. Structural racism affected participants’ finances and led some to forgo care or face barriers to obtaining care. Individual racism resulted in some women electing to receive care only from same-race medical providers.

Grounded in reproductive justice and trauma-informed care, Breastfeeding Awareness and Empowerment (BAE) has developed a program titled BAE Cafe to directly address these gaps by providing community-based lactation and perinatal mental health support. A literature review identified key programmatic gaps, namely, access to knowledge relevant to troubleshooting breastfeeding, peer support, community support and healthcare system support, and system-level factors that impede families and communities from accessing lactation support. (2) Methods: This paper describes BAE Cafe through a group process observation and participant survey. (3) Results: The observation of groups highlighted the core elements of the BAE Cafe model: knowledge, support and mental health support in a peer driven format. Participant survey feedback was overwhelmingly positive and highlighted the critical importance of lactation support for Black women by Black women and BAE’s role in participants’ decisions to continue breastfeeding. (4) Conclusions: BAE Cafe is a replicable, scalable, peer-driven and low-barrier intervention that has the potential to improve outcomes for Black families.

We conducted in-depth review of 20 cases of women from Brazil, Chile and Ecuador who reported being subjected to several forms of obstetric violence while seeking abortion and post-abortion care in formal health facilities. This obstetric violence included denial of care and failure to meet standards of care, criminalisation, gaslighting, physical violence, and discrimination. We show how abortion-related obstetric violence is used as a means to punish and control feminised subjects that contradict social and legal mandates regarding abortion and gender. We also highlight the role of modern legal and medical systems in reproducing oppressive structures that deny people proper care. © 2021 S. Larrea, M.P. Assis and C.O. Mendoza.},

Current gender roles in NA communities are influenced by historical oppression (both historic and contemporary forms) that acted to reverse matrilineal gender norms in favor of patriarchy. The present study sought to explore norms and expectations for women among two NA tribes located in the southeastern region of the United States. The framework of Historical Oppression, Resilience and Transcendence (FHORT), Hill-Collins’s concept of “motherwork,” and a framework of reproductive justice were used to frame the study and interpret findings. This critical ethnography included data from field notes, semistructured interviews, and focus groups. Reconstructive analysis, a specific type of thematic qualitative analysis for critical ethnographies, was used to interpret data. Participants from both tribes described themes related to the expectations and roles of mothers. These expectations included themes of (a) mothers as caretakers, (b) mothers as the centers of family and role models, (c) women to prioritize family over economic and educational aspirations, and (d) decolonizing norms for mothers. While historical oppression and patriarchal norms have constrained and regulated expectations for motherhood and the domestic roles of NA women, these findings also highlight how women decolonize these norms and find ways to reclaim their power through their roles as mothers. © The Author(s) 2020.},

	abstract = {From 1995 to 2014, intrauterine devices (IUDs) rose from ranking 10th (out of 11) among contraceptive methods to being the fourth most popular, outnumbered only by the pill, sterilization, and condoms. In 1995, the IUD had been largely abandoned by American doctors; two decades later, major medical associations promoted it as a "first line" method for prospective users of all ages. This paper explains the rapid and dramatic increase in intrauterine contraception by exploring three influential factors from the 1970s-1980s - the Dalkon Shield disaster, the lack of innovation in contraceptive research and development, and the moral panic over teen pregnancy in America - that created circumstances by the early 2000s in which health care providers became more receptive to long-acting reversible contraception. Key thought leaders in obstetrics and gynecology took it upon themselves to rehabilitate the IUD in the court of medical opinion and succeeded in securing professional approval of the device as the initial step in its resurrection. © The Author(s) 2021.

Incorporating this knowledge into clinical practice may contribute to improving the quality of these services, especially in abortion care, in which loved ones are often excluded. The study took place in Northern California in 2014. We conducted semi-structured, intensive interviews with twenty cis-women about their birth and abortion experiences and analyzed their narratives with respect to accompaniment using grounded theory. The roles of loved ones were complementary yet distinct to those of medical personnel. They were also multifaceted. Participants needed familiar individuals to bear witness, share the emotional experience and provide protection from perceived or possible harm associated with medical care. In some cases, more often in the context of abortion than childbirth, participants shielded their loved ones from emotional burdens of the reproductive process. Some pregnant people of color faced gendered racism, which also influenced their accompaniment needs. Male partners played a distinct role of upholding dominant social ideals related to pregnancy. As is commonplace in birth-related care, abortion services could be formally structured to include partners, family members and friends when desired by pregnant people to improve their experiences. Such integration should be balanced with considerations for privacy, safety and institutional resources. Working toward this goal may reduce structural abortion stigma and help alleviate pregnant people's burdens associated with reproduction. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {This innovative handbook provides a comprehensive, and truly global, overview of the main approaches and themes within law and society scholarship or social-legal studies. A one-volume introduction to academic resources and ideas that are relevant for today's debates on issues from reproductive justice to climate justice, food security, water conflicts, artificial intelligence, and global financial transactions, this handbook is divided into two sections. The first, 'Perspectives and Approaches', accessibly explains a variety of frameworks through which the relationship between law and society is addressed and understood, with emphasis on contemporary perspectives that are relatively new to many socio-legal scholars. Following the book's overall interest in social justice, the entries in this section of the book show how conceptual tools originate in, and help to illuminate, real-world issues. The second and largest section of the book (42 short well-written pieces) presents reflections on topics or areas concerning law, justice, and society that are inherently interdisciplinary and that are relevance to current - but also classical - struggles around justice. Informing readers about the lineage of ideas that are used or could be used today for research and activism, the book attends to the full range of local, national and transnational issues in law and society. The authors were carefully chosen to achieve a diverse and non-Eurocentric view of socio-legal studies. This volume will be invaluable for law students, those in inter-disciplinary programs such as law and society, justice studies and legal studies, and those with interests in law, but based in other social sciences. It will also appeal to general readers interested in questions of justice and rights, including activists and advocates around the world. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Mariana Valverde, Kamari Clarke, Eve Darian-Smith, and Prabha Kotiswaran; individual chapters, the contributors.},

	abstract = {Objective: To better understand medication abortion attitudes and interest in future provision among Internal Medicine primary care providers (IM PCPs), and to characterize barriers to provision. Study Design: We conducted a survey with IM attendings and trainees at a large academic medical center in Western Pennsylvania. We used descriptive statistics to characterize attitudes towards medication abortion provision, including the belief that it is within their scope of practice and interest in future provision, and to explore perceived barriers to provision. We used logistic regression models to assess factors associated with each of these attitudes. Results: Of 397 eligible attendings and trainees, 121 (30%) completed the survey. Among those surveyed, 44% believed medication abortion is within the scope of practice of IM PCPs with trainees and female-identifying providers being significantly more likely to believe medication abortion is within their scope of practice compared to attending physicians and male physicians (60% vs 30%, p < 0.01 and 53% vs 31%, p = 0.01, respectively). Similarly, 43% endorsed interest in future provision, with trainees (67% vs 23%, p < 0.001) and female providers (54% vs 27%, p = 0.002) being more likely to express interest. The most cited barriers to provision included limited training in residency (70%) and low familiarity with abortion medications (57%). Conclusions: Many IM providers— particularly trainees— believe medication abortion is within their scope of practice and would like to provide this care. Interventions are needed to provide education and assistance complying with state and federal regulations to enable safe and efficient medication abortion provision by IM providers. Implications: IM departments and residency programs should seek to ensure training is offered to clinicians interested in providing medication abortion as a part of their primary care practice. © 2021},

Criminal justice systems (CJS) must be appropriately resourced to address these issues. Materials and Methods: We developed a systematic review to understand the intentions and needs for pregnancy prevention and planning among WICJ to inform future reproductive health services. We conducted a systematic literature review of epidemiologic and interventional studies that addressed the pregnancy prevention and planning needs of U.S. WICJ (2000-2019). An initial screen identified 7061 articles and 3 independent reviewers determined that 28 articles (16 descriptive studies in adults, 7 descriptive studies in adolescents, and 5 interventional studies) met inclusion criteria. Results: The literature review identified high rates of contraception underutilization and negative attitudes toward pregnancy among WICJ in a wide variety of settings. WICJ described minimal access to reproductive health services, including evidence-based contraception, and experienced high rates of unplanned and undesired pregnancies. Results were interpreted in the context of the reproductive justice (RJ) framework. Conclusions: The CJS, although not designed to provide health care, should dedicate resources to address the multilevel barriers to care experienced by women. WICJ require targeted, gender-responsive, trauma-informed pregnancy prevention and planning interventions that acknowledge the history of reproductive coercion in this population and address key aspects of RJ, including the right to and to not have a child.  © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.},

How does a women's organization in Africa navigate controversial ethical dilemmas, while dealing with the pressures of imperialism in international development? Based on a case study of the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) in Kenya, this book explores the answers to these questions. It also introduces a theoretical framework drawn from postcolonial feminist critique, narrative identity theory and the work of the Circle of Concerned African Women Theologians: 'everyday Christian ethics'. The book evaluates the theory's implications as a cross-disciplinary theme in feminist studies of religion and theology. Eleanor Tiplady Higgs argues that Kenya YWCA's narratives of its Christian history and constitution sustain a link between its ethical perspective and its identity. The ethical insights that emerge from these practices proclaim the relevance of the value of 'fulfilled lives', as prescribed in the New Testament, for Christian women's experiences of reproductive injustice. © Eleanor Tiplady Higgs, 2021.},

The adverse effects of experimental male hormonal contraceptive regimens include increased weight, suppression of serum high-density cholesterol, and possible mood disturbances. Androgen-progestin or single agents with androgenic and progestogenic properties show the most promise. In multiple efficacy trials, male hormonal contraceptive regimens have demonstrated efficacy that is significantly superior to condoms and comparable to many female hormonal methods.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sugammadex binds progesterone with high affinity and may interfere with hormonal contraceptive effectiveness. The clinical, economical, and ethical implications of unintended pregnancy should prompt anesthesiologists to actively consider and manage this pharmacologic interaction. We surveyed anesthesiology providers at our institution about knowledge of this potential adverse drug interaction, how they manage it clinically, and the extent to which they involve patients in shared decision-making regarding choice of neuromuscular blocker antagonist. METHODS: A survey instrument was distributed to anesthesiology providers at a large, tertiary-care medical center. The survey explored prior experience using neostigmine and sugammadex, knowledge about potential sugammadex interference with hormonal contraception, pre-/postoperative counseling practices, clinical management, and shared decision-making regarding potential use of neostigmine in lieu of sugammadex to avoid this drug-drug interaction. RESULTS: Of 259 surveys distributed, 155 were fully completed, and 10 were partially completed. Overall response rate was 60% (residents 85%, student nurse anesthetists 53%, certified registered nurse anesthetists 58%, attendings 48%). All but 1 respondent recognized the potential for sugammadex interference with oral hormonal contraception. Far fewer accurately identified potential interference with hormonal intrauterine devices (44%) and hormonal contraceptive implants (55%). The manufacturer's recommended 7-day duration of alternative contraception was correctly identified by 72% of respondents; others (22%) reported longer durations (range 10-30 days). Most (78% overall) agreed/strongly agreed that potential interference with contraceptive effectiveness should be discussed with patients preoperatively. Despite the majority (86% overall) that endorsed shared decision-making and inviting patient input regarding choice between sugammadex and neostigmine, many respondents reported "rarely/never" having discussed this drug interaction with patients in actual clinical practice, either preoperatively (67%) or postoperatively (80%). Furthermore, most respondents (79%) reported "rarely/never" administering neostigmine to intentionally avoid this drug interaction. CONCLUSIONS: Two years after designating sugammadex as antagonist of choice, physician and nurse anesthesia providers reported seldom inquiring about contraceptive use among women of childbearing potential and rarely discussing potential risk of contraceptive failure from sugammadex exposure. Most lack accurate knowledge of sugammadex interference with hormonal intrauterine and subcutaneous contraceptive devices. Although most endorse preoperative counseling and support patient autonomy or shared decision-making regarding choice of reversal agent, the same respondents report rarely, if ever, actualizing these positions in clinical practice. These conflicting findings highlight the need for education regarding residual neuromuscular block versus adverse drug interactions, collaboration among providers involved in patient counseling, and intentional mindfulness of reproductive justice when caring for women of childbearing potential. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

	abstract = {This article reviews the literature on the reproductive justice social movement and provides an overview of its main theorical and empirical foundations and contributions. It begins by tracing the emergence of reproductive justice, grounding it in longstanding histories of resistance and Black feminist theorizing. It highlights intersectionality as a social movement strategy and tactic embraced by reproductive justice activists, and highlights reproductive justice organizing and scholarship that contributes to our theoretical understandings of the racial politics of reproduction and abolition. In so doing, this piece makes two interrelated contributions. First, it argues reproductive justice generates material and theoretical contributions beyond the scope of what is possible for reproductive health and rights frameworks. Second, it demonstrates that bringing reproductive justice into the focus of sociological inquiry is important for advancing social science scholarship. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {In this article, I seek to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted childbirth in Puerto Rico, an island that was already in recovery following the occurrence of two devastating hurricanes in the fall of 2017 and a major earthquake in the winter of 2020. Thus, I argue that it is important to discuss not only how individual disasters impact birth, but also how their compounding effects do so. In order to address these research questions, I conducted remote interviews with Puerto Rican birth workers and researchers. During times of crisis, this pandemic included, home and midwife-attended births have become increasingly more popular. However, Puerto Rican midwives and doulas currently have less institutional support than ever. In a time of quarantine when home births are rising, we need to consider whether society is designed to facilitate these models of care. In Puerto Rico, pre-pandemic, there was a less than 1% home birth rate and there still is a lack of legal recognition and protections for homebirth midwives. As this article demonstrates, an acknowledgment of the near-invisible labors of these birth workers is needed, in addition to supplies, support, and protections for them—and not just in times of “crisis.” © Copyright © 2021 Reyes.},

	abstract = {Long-acting Reversible Contraception (LARC) has significant promise both from a public health outlook and a social justice perspective. However, if women’s empowerment is to be supported, then perspectives and experiences of LARC must be considered. This scoping review assesses research about contraceptive users’ perspectives and experiences of contraceptive decision-making and practices. A content analysis was conducted to identify research trends in qualitative studies of contraceptive-user perspectives (n = 54), located by means of a systematic search. Interpreting findings through a reproductive justice lens, three main limitations in the scholarship were identified, viz., (1) an instrumentalist, individual-level focus; (2) a lack of consideration for diverse perspectives; and (3) an uncritical focus on young women. While the small body of qualitative research on LARC offers some valuable insights, when viewed from a sexual and reproductive justice perspective, it is not sufficiently user-centered or grounded within the reproductive politics surrounding contraceptive care and provision. Research is needed that draws on appropriate social theory; widens its focus beyond dominant groups; and is cognizant of the multi-level power relations surrounding LARC. Such work provides a nuanced picture of the complex social and contextual factors at play and inform person-centered approaches in sexual and reproductive health policy and programming. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

However, it is also important to investigate protective factors, as well as how risk and protective factors work together across contexts. The present study explored both contextual facilitators and barriers to refugee young women’s sexual health and how these factors intersect to influence behavior. Interviews were conducted with twelve female refugees ages 18-24. Participants’ countries of origin included Burma, Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Somalia; most participants had lived in the United States for over five years. Data were analyzed using thematic text analysis and narrative analysis. Findings revealed four primary themes: sex/relationship restrictions, judgment/disapproval, support, and youth outcomes. Themes varied by context (e.g., family, peers, religion, culture) and were related to one another in important ways, such that refugee young women who violate sociocultural sex/relationship expectations experience actual or anticipated judgment from others, which leads to fear, embarrassment, and risky sexual behavior. However, participants also shared that social and institutional support would contribute to improved sexual health outcomes. Findings highlight the importance of considering refugee young women’s sociocultural contexts when addressing sexual health challenges. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Findings indicated that those across the gender spectrum had similar levels of awareness of these expectations, demonstrating that personal experiences are not necessarily a prerequisite for awareness. Other identity markers like age, socioeconomic status, and parenting status did have some impact.

	abstract = {Amidst a raft of major Supreme Court decisions, a relatively quiet concurrence has planted the seeds for what may precipitate a major transformation in American constitutional law. Writing for himself in Box v. Planned Parenthood, Justice Thomas chided the Court for declining to review a decision invalidating an Indiana law that prohibited abortions undertaken “solely because of the child’s race, sex, diagnosis of Down syndrome, disability, or related characteristics.” Arguing that the challenged law was merely Indiana’s modest attempt to prevent “abortion from becoming a tool of modern-day eugenics,” Justice Thomas proceeded to elaborate a misleading history in which he associated abortion with eugenics, racism, and a broader campaign to improve the human race by limiting Black reproduction. While many decried his selective and inaccurate invocation of the history of eugenics, Justice Thomas’s ambitions for the concurrence likely went beyond the historical record. Indeed, in drafting the concurrence, Justice Thomas may have been less concerned with history than with the future - and specifically the future of abortion rights and the jurisprudence of race. As this Article explains, the concurrence’s misleading association of abortion and eugenics may well serve two purposes. First, it justifies trait-selection laws, an increasingly popular type of abortion restriction, on the ground that such measures serve the state’s interest in eliminating various forms of discrimination. But more importantly, and less obviously, by associating abortion with eugenic racism, the concurrence lays a foundation for discrediting - and overruling - Roe v. Wade on the alleged ground that the abortion right is rooted in, and tainted by, an effort to selectively target Black reproduction. Under the principle of stare decisis, a past decision, like Roe v. Wade, cannot be overruled simply because a majority of the current Court disagrees with it. Instead, a “special justification” is required. Justice Thomas’s association of abortion with eugenics constructs the case that racial injustice is the “special justification” that warrants overruling Roe. In this regard, the Box concurrence builds on past decisions, like Brown v. Board of Education, as well as more recent cases, like Ramos v. Louisiana, in which the Court overruled past precedents, in part, to correct racial wrongs. If undertaken, the Box concurrence’s latent strategy will be devastating to abortion rights, but as this Article explains, its deleterious impact goes beyond eviscerating Roe v. Wade. Under the concurrence’s logic, race may serve dual purposes in shaping the Court’s jurisprudence. As an initial matter, race - and the prospect of redressing racial injustice - furnishes the Court with a potent justification for reconsidering settled precedent. But it also provides the Court with an opportunity to articulate new law that affirms and entrenches the Court’s preferred conception of race and racial harm. In this regard, the Box concurrence is not merely an invitation to recast abortion as an issue of racial injustice; it is an invitation to entirely reconceptualize the meaning of race, racial injury, and racism. © 2021, Harvard Law Review Association.

Aim: To interrogate the significance of feminism in midwifery practice, identifying feminist successes and further opportunities for implementation including: analysis of the Midwifery Standards for Practice; the primary tenets of woman-centred care; the content versus context of midwifery in Australia; and feminist opportunities for enhanced practice. This paper will discuss the importance of feminism in midwifery practice and its significance in informing optimal midwifery care. Discussion: Incorporating women's voice and respecting women's bodies and agency in the delivery of care is a fundamental component of midwifery practice. However, while the content of midwifery practice is innately feminist in its emphasis on woman-centred care, it will be argued that the context of birthing in Australia is not. The resultant effect is the emergence of victim blaming in maternity care and the construction of an archetypal ‘good birthing woman’. Implications and recommendations: Moving away from the myth of the ‘good birthing woman’ and the act of victim blaming, midwifery could instead direct its focus towards challenging the rigid systems and structures within which midwives implement care. By further embracing feminist principles midwives will ensure a truly woman-centred future. © 2020 Australian College of Midwives},

	abstract = {Background: Sexual assault (SA) is common, but Black individuals might be at higher risk of SA and negative health sequalae. Racial differences in SA characteristics and health care utilization after SA are largely unknown. Materials and Methods: We reviewed medical records of 690 individuals (23.9% Black; 93.6% women) who received a SA medical forensic exam (SAMFE) at a southeastern U.S. hospital. We examined bivariate racial differences in SA characteristics and used zero-inflated Poisson regressions to estimate racial differences in mental health outpatient visits at the SAMFE hospital. Results: Among survivors of SA, Black survivors were more likely than White survivors to have been victimized by an intimate partner (odds ratio [OR] = 1.77, confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.02-3.07) and they had more post-SA outpatient mental health visits at the SAMFE hospital (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.70-2.47). Black survivors were less likely to report alcohol or drug use before the SA (OR = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.28-0.62). In multivariable models, Black survivors trended toward more mental health visits than White survivors (IRR = 1.63, 95% CI = 0.82-2.44), but intimate partner violence (IPV) significantly moderated that association (IRR = 0.01, 95%CI = ≤0.001-0.03). Black survivors assaulted by an intimate partner were less likely to access mental health care than White IPV survivors. Conclusions: The hospital setting of a SAMFE could be a unique opportunity to serve Black survivors and reduce racial disparities in mental health sequelae, but additional support will be needed for Black survivors experiencing IPV. An intersectional, reproductive justice framework has the potential to address these challenges.  © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.},

	abstract = {Objective: In 2018, 17 percent of all births in the United States occurred to women of advanced maternal age (AMA.) While the outcomes of AMA pregnancies have been examined extensively, the drivers behind increasing rates of AMA pregnancies in the United States are less understood. Some scholars have asserted that women are increasingly delaying their first birth in favor of educational and career aspirations. Yet birth trends in the United States do not support this as the primary explanatory factor of AMA births. Other factors may also contribute to high rates of AMA in the United States. This study sought to identify main predictors of AMA birth using a cross-sectional retrospective sample. Design: We employed a multivariate logistic regression analysis on a cross-sectional retrospective sample to identify significant independent predictors of giving birth at advance maternal age (AMA) in the United States. Setting: Data was obtained from the Unites States Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) Phase 7 Core Questionnaire and linked birth certificates. Questions are designed to assess maternal attitudes and experiences before, during and just after pregnancy. Surveys for Phase 7 were completed in 2017 and 2018. The study population represents mothers from 34 states that met the CDC's 55% response rate threshold and Puerto Rico. Participants: The PRAMS dataset comprises self-reported data and linked birth certificate data from women who recently gave birth. A total of 38,549 mothers are included in the Phase 7 dataset. State sample sizes ranged from 503 mothers in Wyoming to 1,897 mothers in Michigan. All mothers gave birth in the year 2017. Measurements and Findings: The outcome of interest was AMA birth, defined as conceiving and subsequently giving birth to a baby at age 35 or older. Predictors for AMA birth were selected a priori and included: pregnancy intention, history of previous live birth, insurance status, income, education, race/ethnicity, marital status, and urban location. Previous live birth to at least one child was a significant independent predictor for AMA birth. Mothers with high parity, defined as 6 or more previous live births, were 17 times more likely to give birth at advanced maternal age. Mothers with an unwanted pregnancy were 1.9 times more likely to have an AMA birth. College attainment, high income, marital status, urbanicity, and race/ethnicity were also independent predictors of AMA birth. Health insurance was not a significant predictor of AMA birth after accounting for other factors. Key Conclusions: Delayed and late childbirth may not be intentional for a significant group of older mothers. Converse to popular assumptions that women delay childbearing in favor of career aspirations, the majority of AMA mothers have previous children. Half of AMA mothers have two or more previous children. The findings in this paper suggests that multiple factors predict AMA births. There may be several subtypes of women who enter pregnancy at advanced maternal age. Implications for Practice: As women weigh personal desire to bear children against competing social expectations, they may find themselves navigating their own unique path shaped in part by the region in which they live. Better characterization of the circumstances that lead to advanced maternal age in the United States, including exploration of unintended and unwanted AMA pregnancy, is necessary to develop policies and interventions that meet women's needs. This work should utilize a reproductive justice framework to ensure that women's preferences, particularly women of color, are upheld while promoting health and wellbeing for women. © 2021},

We survey the eugenic rationale of the State where the law allows for termination of early-stage pregnancies, while later pregnancies can be terminated on medical grounds alone, with a notable exception made when the foetus is ‘abnormal,’ granting an almost unconditional right to abortion. Relying on some prominent disability rights activists’ positions on disability-selective abortions, we examine court orders to highlight exceedingly inconsistent Indian jurisprudence on disability-selective abortion. We employ theories of the social model on disability and the reproductive justice framework to advocate for a rights-cum-reproductive justice approach. Such a nuanced approach would ensure that during pre-natal screenings that indicate disability or ‘foetal abnormalities’ as they are termed in Indian law, pregnant persons would have the most accurate and comprehensive information about the diagnosis, including realistic information about living with disabilities from persons with disabilities, as well as orienting them to certain basic ideas and concepts that look at the specific rights and entitlements of persons with disabilities. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to O.P.

This is part of a broader pattern of stratified reproduction–structural conditions that enable or discourage certain groups from reproducing–that often brings about and exacerbates injustices. This paper critically assesses the US and UK social and medical literature on applying pressure to marginalised groups, or those who have behaved ‘irresponsibly’, to use long-acting reversible contraception (LARC). Targeting young people for LARC fails to recognise that social inequality is the context for teenage pregnancy, not the result of it. Provider pressure on women of colour to use LARC is linked to institutional racism, whilst policy for those with physical and intellectual disabilities is shaped by disability discrimination. Other groups to be targeted include so-called ‘welfare mothers’, substance users, those who have had children put into care and offenders. Particularly controversial are cases in which LARC has been ordered by courts. LARC policy incorporating these kind of discriminatory practices needs to stop; future policy should focus on person-centred care that bolsters reproductive justice. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

To this end, I demonstrate that entities such as Planned Parenthood International (IPPF), have considerable relevance in national and international spaces dedicated to debate on reproductive rights and thereby influence the production of eugenicist and colonial speeches about the countries of the Global South. Applying a Black feminist lens of reproductive justice to the Brazilian context, this article shows how discourses relating to the birth control of Black and poor Brazilian women were absorbed by Brazil when the country oversaw a mass sterilisation process under the influence of the United States between 1970 and 1990. I further demonstrate how such eugenicist policies still remain in force in the Brazilian State today, which in 2018 carried out, through its judiciary, a forced sterilisation surgery on Janaína Quirino, a poor Black Brazilian and woman. This analysis shows that the colonial discourse regarding the control of so-called disposable populations never left the country, being institutionalised even by the entities that should protect (and not violate) Brazilian women. © 2021 Australian Feminist Law Journal Inc.},

	abstract = {Twenty-five years since the Fourth World Conference on Women, as a result of feminist organising and activism, there has been substantial law reform and transformation in South Africa. Yet, as for many countries in southern Africa, we have yet to see full implementation and universal access to services for girls and women. This article in offering reflections from the past 25 years, notes how the new democratic government set about replacing the apartheid policy of population control after 1994. It is argued that despite progress, population control remains embedded within programming for sexual and reproductive health and rights in South Africa. The contextual barriers represented by the gender effects of the HIV epidemic for women, government denialism and poor financing as well as navigation of donor practices are inextricably entwined with the realisation of sexual and reproductive health and rights over this period. What is of concern is the influence and dependence on international non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and donors in policy, programming and implementation, particularly against the history of ‘Gag laws’ imposed by conservative governments, effectively rolling back reproductive services and therefore rights. Two related reproductive health indicators, contraception and abortion, are tracked noting how these have been framed, programmed, developed and also changed over the past quarter of a century in South Africa. Within a human rights perspective together with a social justice rubric, narrating the key struggles for reproductive justice provides an opportunity to review sexuality and reproduction from the individual to a wider context, locating struggles and challenges within families, communities and society. While there have been substantial changes and reforms over this time systemic injustices persist. These remain racialised with black and poor women bearing the brunt of high rates of maternal morbidity and mortality, even more so during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 M. Stevens.},

	abstract = {In a turbulent era, with illiberal nationalism on the rise and international laws and institutions under persistent threat, this book asks what future the international human rights system has. It rejects the claims of those who view human rights law and advocacy as ineffective or worse in challenging injustice. Instead, it presents an experimentalist account of human rights which emphasizes the ongoing engagement between domestic activists and international and domestic institutions and actors in promoting rights-based change. Rather than the monolithic movement depicted in some academic critiques, it discerns a rich and diverse human rights movement which has helped significantly to challenge injustice and advance progressive change in many contexts. Drawing on case studies of gender justice, disability rights, children’s rights and reproductive justice from Pakistan, Argentina and Ireland, the book argues that the human rights movement has made an important difference around the world. It shows that despite daunting contemporary challenges including illiberalism, climate change, inequalities, pandemics and digitalization, human rights advocates and activists are engaged in critical self-reflection, renewal and reform that should enable the human rights movement to engage effectively with these challenges in the future. Indeed, the formidable challenges of our current turbulent era provide powerful reasons to reform, innovate, and strengthen the tools and practices of the human rights movement for the future, rather than abandon it, encourage others to do so, or herald its demise. © G de Búrca 2021.},

	abstract = {Abortion funds are key actors in mitigating barriers to abortion access, particularly in contexts where state-level abortion access restrictions are concentrated. Using 2017–2019 case management data from a regional abortion fund in the southeastern U.S., we described the sociodemographic and service use characteristics of cases overall (n = 9585) and stratified by state of residence (Al-abama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee). Overall, cases represented people seeking abortion fund assistance who predominately identified as non-Hispanic Black (81%), 18–34 years of age (84%), publicly or uninsured (87%), having completed a high school degree or some college (70%), having one or more children (77%), and as Christian (58%). Most cases involved an in-state clinic (81%), clinic travel distance under 50 miles (63%), surgical abortion (66%), and pregnancy under 13 weeks’ gestation (73%), with variation across states. The median abortion fund contribution pledge was $75 (interquartile range (IQR): 60–100), supplementing median caller contributions of $200 (IQR: 40–300). These data provide a unique snapshot of a population navigating disproportionate, intersecting barriers to abortion access, and abortion fund capacity for social care and science. Findings can inform abortion fund development, data quality improvement efforts, as well as reproductive health, rights and justice advocacy, policy, and research. © 2021 by the authors.

The burden of an unplanned pregnancy is not equally distributed among racial and ethnic groups in the United States based on the rates of unplanned pregnancies. Objective: This article discusses the disparity in the utilization of contraception among Black women through a reproductive justice lens. Results: The reasons for these differences include a lack of access to care, and differences in contraceptive failure rates among racial and ethnic groups, as well as less of an inclination to have an abortion. Barriers to contraception for breastfeeding persons include patient medical conditions and concerns, and resistance by other health care providers due to language and cultural differences, and knowledge asymmetry. Institutionalized racism, transphobia, and homophobia may compromise patient access to the full spectrum of contraceptive options available. Conclusions: Given the individual and public health benefits of breastfeeding and the impact those benefits can have in helping Black birthing persons and children achieve health equity, it is important for obstetric and pediatric health care providers to play their part in encouraging and supporting breastfeeding.  © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.},

Here, we use data from semi-structured interviews with 17 patients at a sexual health clinic about their experience obtaining contraception to explore the process of choosing a method. Participants were recruited through posters in the clinic waiting room and via information posted on the clinic's social media feeds. Interviews were thematically analyzed, and two main themes identifi ed. Th e first theme was the importance of seeking out information online and from social networks prior to seeing a provider, to the extent that most participants had settled on a method prior to their discussion with a physician. The second theme was the priorities identified by participants in their decision-making, primarily side eff ects. Th e findings suggest that key moments of decision-making may not take place during a contraceptive counselling appointment, but rather beforehand through independent research, discussions with others, and previous experiences with contraception. The experiences of participants in this study indicate that contraceptive counselling should include discussion of the information patients have gleaned from other sources and acknowledge the importance of experiential information as well as factual. © 2021 University of Toronto Press Inc..

	abstract = {"Salvaging the Bones Means Fighting for Reproductive Justice" argues that Jesmyn Ward's novel is a pivotal contribution to twenty-first-century discussions of reproductive justice and a powerful challenge to Republican rhetoric and policy that impact Black mothers and their children. Like Black scholars of reproductive justice, the novel critiques medical and governmental institutions that neglect women by limiting access to reproductive health care such as abortion services, prenatal care, and postnatal care, and fostering health care environments that deny Black women's full humanity and value as mothers. My analysis of maternal death and teen pregnancy in the novel shows how Ward links bodily and psychic trauma to institutional structures that injure Black women and their children. In this way, I reveal how literary works can help readers connect trauma to structural causes and begin to envision social and institutional change. By combining close readings with a discussion of attacks on reproductive health care in the South, I ultimately argue that Ward offers an urgent literary indictment of structures that produce maternal trauma and calls readers to engage with visions of reproductive justice that will allow Black mothers and their children to thrive. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

	abstract = {Over the past decade, increasing attention has been paid to intervening in individuals' health in the "preconception" period as an approach to optimizing pregnancy outcomes. Increasing attention to the structural and social determinants of health and to the need to prioritize reproductive autonomy has underscored the need to evolve the preconception health framework to center race equity and to engage with the historical and social context in which reproduction and reproductive health care occur. In this commentary, we describe the results of a meeting with a multidisciplinary group of maternal and child health experts, reproductive health researchers and practitioners, and Reproductive Justice leaders to define a new approach for clinical and public health systems to engage with the health of nonpregnant people. We describe a novel "Reproductive and Sexual Health Equity" framework, defined as an approach to comprehensively meet people's reproductive and sexual health needs, with explicit attention to structural influences on health and health care and grounded in a desire to achieve the highest level of health for all people and address inequities in health outcomes. Principles of the framework include centering the needs of and redistributing power to communities, having clinical and public health systems acknowledge historical and ongoing harms related to reproductive and sexual health, and addressing root causes of inequities. We conclude with a call to action for a multisectoral effort centered in equity to advance reproductive and sexual health across the reproductive life course. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

	abstract = {Although reproductive injustices and reproductive health disparities are well-documented in the United States, recent studies have begun to explore the health care professional's role in their perpetuation. We hypothesized that obstetrics and gynecology residents would observe reproductive injustices during their training. Thus, using a national survey, we asked obstetrics and gynecology residents to share clinical cases in which discrimination, bias, inequity, or injustice was involved in a patient's reproductive health care and queried their preparedness to respond. Through qualitative analysis, we found that respondents shared cases involving racism, discrimination, and structural barriers to care and that they felt poorly equipped to handle injustice. We call for clinician educators to combat reproductive injustice through three key changes to obstetrics and gynecology residency training: 1) incorporate reproductive justice training into formal residency education; 2) create safe spaces for residents to collectively debrief about their experiences with injustice and collaborate on care improvement; and 3) teach community engagement and advocacy skills that identify, center, and elevate local reproductive health priorities. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Although there is evidence linking structural determinants to these inequities, clinical learners have limited exposure to these topics in their training.

Through literature review, we identified structural competency as the foundational framework and explored community priorities for clinical training. We assessed learner needs regarding structural equity training, articulated goals and objectives, and chose video modules as the primary educational strategy. We collaboratively developed content with community scholars and reproductive justice advocates. For phase 1 of our curriculum, we created pillar videos with reflection questions, resources, and a visual glossary of key terms. All materials are available through an online educational platform offering open-Access, evidence-based curricula.EXPERIENCE:We launched our curriculum with a social media campaign and presented our videos at several national convenings. We implemented videos with clinical learners with positive preliminary evaluation results.CONCLUSION:With rigorous development rooted in community engagement, our curriculum contributes to the tools promoting structural equity training in obstetrics and gynecology. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

	abstract = {Mifepristone (brand name Mifeprex) is a prescription drug that has been safely used in the United States for twenty years to end early pregnancies and, more recently, to treat early miscarriages. Although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) acknowledges that mifepristone's safety and efficacy are “well-established by both research and experience” [1], it imposes a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) that severely restricts where, how, and from whom this medication can be obtained. Most notably, FDA requires that mifepristone be dispensed at a hospital, clinic, or medical office—not by mail or through a retail or mail-order pharmacy—even though patients can receive all evaluation and counseling via telemedicine and can self-administer the mifepristone tablet, unsupervised, at the location of their choice. Of more than 20,000 FDA-approved drugs [2], mifepristone is the only one FDA requires patients to pick up in a clinical setting even though they do not have to take it under clinical supervision [3]. FDA's singular restrictions on mifepristone are not only clinically unjustified, but unlawful. On behalf of leading medical associations, individual physicians, and reproductive justice advocates, our organization, the American Civil Liberties Union, has taken FDA to court—twice—because the agency's restrictions on mifepristone do not satisfy the strict constraints Congress established for REMS programs and erect profound and unnecessary barriers to care in violation of the U.S. Constitution. © 2021},

	abstract = {To reduce rates of unintended pregnancy, medical and public health associations endorse a contraceptive counseling model that ranks birth control methods by failure rate. This tiered model outlines all forms of birth control but recommends long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC) to eliminate user error and increase continuation. Our critical discourse analysis of gynecology textbooks and medical recommendations examines how gendered and neoliberal ideas influence risk assessments underlying the tiered contraceptive counseling model. Specifically, we explore how embodied, lifestyle, and medical risks are constructed to prioritize contraceptive failure over adverse side effects and reproductive autonomy. We find that the tiered model's focus on contraceptive failure is justified by a discourse that speciously conflates distinct characteristics of pharmaceuticals: efficacy (ability to produce intended effect) and safety (lack of unintended adverse outcomes). Efficacy discourse, which filters all logic through the lens of intended effect, magnifies lifestyle and embodied risks over medical risks by constructing two biased risk assessments. The first risk assessment defines ovulation, menstruation, and pregnancy as hazardous (i.e., embodied risk); the second insinuates that cisgender women who do not engage in contraceptive self-management are burdensome to society (i.e., lifestyle risk). Combined, these assessments downplay side effects (i.e., medical risks), suggesting that LARC and other pharma-contraceptives are worth the risk to protect cisgender women from their fertile bodies and to guard society against unintended pregnancy. Through this process, ranking birth control methods by failure rates rather than by side effects or reproductive autonomy becomes logical as efficacy is equated with safety for cisgender women and society. Our analysis reveals how technoscientific solutions are promoted to address social problems, and how informed contraceptive choice is diminished when pharma-contraceptives are framed as the most logical option without cogent descriptions of their associated risks. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, women in Western countries have taken to various social media platforms to share their dissatisfactory experiences with hormonal contraception, which may be pills, patches, rings, injectables, implants or hormonal intrauterine devices (IUDs). These online testimonials have been denounced as spreading “hormonophobia”, i.e. an excessive fear of hormones based on irrational causes such as an overestimation of health risks associated with their use, that was already aroused by the recurring media controversies over hormonal contraception. In order to move toward a reproductive justice framework, we propose to study the arguments that women and men (as partners of female users) recently put forward against hormonal contraception to see whether they are related to hormonophobia. The aim of this article is to conduct a systematic review of the recent scientific literature in order to construct an evidence-based typology of reasons for rejecting hormonal contraception, in a continuum perspective from complaints to choosing not to use it, cited by women and men in Western countries in a recent time. The published literature was systematically searched using PubMed and the database from the French National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined). A total of 42 articles were included for full-text analysis. Eight main categories emerged as reasons for rejecting hormonal contraception: problems related to physical side effects; altered mental health; negative impact on sexuality; concerns about future fertility; invocation of nature; concerns about menstruation; fears and anxiety; and the delegitimization of the side effects of hormonal contraceptives. Thus, arguments against hormonal contraception appeared complex and multifactorial. Future research should examine the provider-patient relationship, the gender bias of hormonal contraception and demands for naturalness in order to understand how birth control could better meet the needs and expectations of women and men in Western countries today. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {In US political discourse, anti-abortion framing traditionally focuses on the right to life of the fetus. However, a “pro-life, pro-woman” frame increasingly gained ground among anti-abortion advocates inside and outside of elected office throughout the turn of the 21st century. The pro-woman frame in contemporary anti-abortion discourse situates abortion as inherently harmful for women–both psychologically and physically–and insists that women deserve better than abortion. By introducing regulatory abortion bills that “educate” women about abortion or protect them from potential harm of abortion, anti-abortion lawmakers may claim they are advocates for women. Though social movement scholars document the shift in focus from the fetus to the woman in anti-abortion movement rhetoric, it is equally important to trace this frame transformation among anti-abortion legislators. To uncover the presence of the pro-woman frame, this article analyzes anti-abortion bills introduced in all 50 US states from 2008 to 2017. The findings indicate that the pro-woman frame is found throughout a majority of the bills, which marks a significant use and acceptance of the frame by US state legislators. This frame transformation represents a strategic tactic of anti-abortion legislators to soften political behavior and beliefs that are seen as hostile toward women, especially during a time where there is an unprecedented amount of anti-abortion bills introduced in the states. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

In doing so, it contributes to feminist scholarship bridging environmental and reproductive justice. Through a case study of water provisioning in Camden, New Jersey, the analysis reveals the added burden of gendered care-work under racialized conditions of environmental insecurity, where many suspect threats to community health but are denied legitimacy for their claims. I show how residents contest official declarations of water quality through narratives of water insecurity, linking everyday injustices to histories of slow violence. Such insecurity intensifies the gendered and racialized labor required to care for children. As mothers mitigate risk through daily provisioning, many resort to buying bottled water in an effort to gain control over their reproductive labor. While it may seem that mothers are opting for privatized solutions, they frame this strategy as a necessary response to the state’s failure to secure the conditions of social reproduction. Situating mothers’ everyday care-work alongside activists’ critiques of privatization, the paper advances a multi-scalar analysis of environmental justice that connects the intimate, embodied sphere of reproduction to the institutional terrain of neoliberal restructuring. Key to this struggle is combatting neoliberal logics of mother-blame that locate risk within the labor of caregiving. Ultimately, I argue, struggles to sustain reproductive labor against the threat of slow violence illuminate the need for collective infrastructures of care that prioritize life-making over profit-making. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Methods We conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured focus groups in 2018 with women in a provincial prison in Ontario, Canada. We asked participants about their experiences and perspectives of pregnancy and contraception related to healthcare in prison. We used a combination of deductive and inductive content analysis to categorize data. A concept map was generated using a reproductive justice framework. Results The data reflected three components of a reproductive justice framework: 1) women have limited access to healthcare in prison, 2) reproductive safety and dignity influence attitudes toward pregnancy and contraception, and 3) women in prison want better reproductive healthcare. Discrimination and stigma were commonly invoked throughout women’s experiences in seeking reproductive healthcare. Conclusions Improving reproductive healthcare for women in prison is crucial to promoting reproductive justice in this population. Efforts to increase access to comprehensive, responsive, and timely reproductive healthcare should be informed by the needs and desires of women in prison and should actively seek to reduce their experience of discrimination and stigma in this context.

	abstract = {Building the Population Bomb examines how human population came to be understood as a problem in the twentieth century, how it became an object of intervention for governments, scientists, and nongovernmental organizations, and how some forms of intervention got coded as legitimate while others were recognized as coercive. It traces the emergence and growth of two scientific perspectives on population from the 1920s to the present. The first, rooted in the natural sciences, considered the world’s population as a whole in relation to natural resources. The second, rooted in the social sciences, considered national population growth rates in relation to economic growth. These two perspectives converged briefly after World War II, convincing world leaders that population growth posed a barrier to economic development and a threat to worldwide peace and environmental integrity. The book documents how this overpopulation consensus attracted vast sums of money to demography and population control, and teases out the differences between population control, birth control, and family planning. It concludes with the fracturing of this consensus at the end of the 1960s, constituting the factions that structure today’s debates over whether the world’s population is growing too quickly or not quickly enough, and over what should be done about it. The book documents how population growth came to take the blame for the world’s most complex and pressing problems, and how efforts to solve “the population problem” have diverted attention and resources from the pursuit of economic, environmental, and reproductive justice. © Oxford University Press 2021.},

Working through the development of this project, this article models one way to enact politically engaged feminist research at each stage of the research process, from developing the research question, through research design, data collection, analysis, and theory generation. In the process, three core principles of feminist research methodologies are extended: co-construction of knowledge, researcher reflexivity, and reciprocal relationships in research. This research is caught up in and responds to a fraught political context where supports for reproductive healthcare are limited, and midwifery, abortion, and gender-affirming care are all framed as “fringe” services that exceed the austerity budget of the province. Participants engaged in this study with a clear understanding of this political terrain and approached interviews as an opportunity to share their experiences, and to advocate for the continuation and expansion of midwifery and related services in the province. Through the research process, it has become evident that midwifery must be understood as part of the struggle toward reproductive justice in this province. These reflections will direct further stages of the project, including ongoing research and dissemination. © The Author(s) 2021.},

Unlike sexual abstinence-based approaches promoted as a panacea for reducing “early pregnancy” in Brazil, reproductive justice is posited as a framework for addressing health inequities in family planning. This article discuss-es the challenges faced by public health policies in supporting adolescents and young people in their sexual and reproductive trajectories, drawing on the concept of intersectionality. We focus on public institutional initiatives providing long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC) on the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) implemented over the last decade. We conducted a documentary anthropological study drawing on empirical data on contraceptive technologies in order to prob-lematize what we call the “selective provision” of these devices and discriminatory and stigmatizing practices. Advocating the expansion of the provision of contraception on the SUS, with universal access to LARC for all women, distances itself from what we call “contraceptive coercion” among specific social groups. © 2021, Associacao Brasileira de Pos - Graduacao em Saude Coletiva.

An example is the WHO health systems approach that connects people (needs, rights, perspectives) with services and technologies (equitable access, quality of care, mix of interventions) and with policies and institutional capacities (laws, regulations, human/physical resources, management and financing). The approach is comprehensive and multi-faceted, which is a strength. We argue, however, that health systems analyses should be supplemented with a focus on reproductive justice. Using the WHO health systems approach as an exemplar, we show how the reparative reproductive justice approach outlined by the first author and colleagues assists with outlining comprehensive remedies to the inequities identified in the systems analysis. We argue for attention to remedies at individual and collective, material and symbolic levels. We illustrate our argument using unsafe abortion, legal abortion services and post-abortion care in Lesotho as a case study. We outline the policies, services and people components of abortion in Lesotho using the WHO systems model, followed by a reparative justice analysis of remedies. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Recent Findings: Reproductive justice is a framework that advocates for the promotion of universal sexual and reproductive freedoms, particularly among historically marginalized communities. This framework takes a holistic view of individuals and sees the interconnections between sexual health, reproductive health, and overall health. Employing a sexual and reproductive justice perspective is essential to understanding and helping to mitigate the role intersecting structural, sexual, and reproductive oppressions, including those demonstrated through promotion of longer acting contraception, and can critically inform rollout of future prevention technologies, such as longer acting HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis. Summary: This review highlights the need for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers to apply lessons learned from contraception and specifically focuses on principles of reproductive justice to offer expanding HIV prevention options. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Objective: Despite gendered dimensions of COVID-19 becoming increasingly apparent, the impact of COVID-19 and other respiratory epidemics on women and girls’ sexual and reproductive health (SRH) have yet to be synthesized. This review uses a reproductive justice framework to systematically review empirical evidence of the indirect impacts of respiratory epidemics on SRH. Methods: We searched MEDLINE and CINAHL for original, peer-reviewed articles related to respiratory epidemics and women and girls’ SRH through May 31, 2021. Studies focusing on various SRH outcomes were included, however those exclusively examining pregnancy, perinatal-related outcomes, and gender-based violence were excluded due to previously published systematic reviews on these topics. The review consisted of title and abstract screening, full-text screening, and data abstraction. Results: Twenty-four studies met all eligibility criteria. These studies emphasized that COVID-19 resulted in service disruptions that effected access to abortion, contraceptives, HIV/STI testing, and changes in sexual behaviors, menstruation, and pregnancy intentions. Conclusions: These findings highlight the need to enact policies that ensure equitable, timely access to quality SRH services for women and girls, despite quarantine and distancing policies. Research gaps include understanding how COVID-19 disruptions in SRH service provision, access and/or utilization have impacted underserved populations and those with intersectional identities, who faced SRH inequities notwithstanding an epidemic. More robust research is also needed to understand the indirect impact of COVID-19 and epidemic control measures on a wider range of SRH outcomes (e.g., menstrual disorders, fertility services, gynecologic oncology) in the long-term. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Gaps in family planning, after 25 years of the Family Planning Law in Brazil, have promoted a resignification of fertility control. Difficulties in performing tubal ligation in the Unified Health System have allowed governmental stratified and racialized strategies of access to long-acting reversible contraceptive methods (LARC) to flourish. The ethnographic research relies on documentary sources on institutional initiatives for the inclusion of LARC in the public health system, taking the municipality of Sao Paulo as a paradigmatic empirical case. Apparently related to the ideology of citizenship, we argue that such technologies of government go into the opposite direction to the expansion of sexual and reproductive rights, reifying social stereotypes that subtract women's reproductive autonomy. Using the concept of “contraceptive coercion” as a category of analysis, we demonstrate how such strategies injure the reproductive justice paradigm, by institutionalizing social exclusion through the uterus of “vulnerable” women in Brazil. © 2021.

Historically, marginalized individuals have experienced reproductive oppression in multiple forms. This oppression continues in modern times through health policy and patient-clinician communication. To combat this, the framework of reproductive justice outlines four key actions: analyzing power systems, addressing intersecting oppressions, centering the most marginalized, and joining together across issues and identities. Primary care clinicians have a unique role and responsibility to carry out these four key actions in order to provide patient centered reproductive care. To translate reproductive justice into clinical practice, clinicians care can use reflective practice, the framework of cultural humility, and the concepts from the explanatory model of illness. © 2020, Society of General Internal Medicine (This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply).},

	abstract = {Purpose of reviewLong-acting reversible contraception (LARC) is comprised of highly effective methods (the subdermal implant and intrauterine devices) available to adolescents and young adults (AYAs). Professional medical societies endorse LARC use in AYAs and, more recently, have emphasized the importance of using a reproductive justice framework when providing LARC. This article reviews reproductive justice, discusses contraceptive coercion, examines bias, and highlights interventions that promote equitable reproductive healthcare.Recent findingsResearch indicates that both bias and patient characteristics influence provider LARC practices. AYA access to comprehensive LARC services is limited, as counseling, provision, management, and removal are not offered at all sites providing reproductive healthcare to AYAs. Interventions aimed at addressing provider bias and knowledge, clinic policies, confidentiality concerns, insurance reimbursement, and systems of oppression can improve AYA access to equitable, comprehensive contraceptive care. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated inequities in reproductive healthcare, as well as provided unique innovations to decrease barriers, including telemedicine LARC services.SummaryClinicians who care for AYAs should honor reproductive autonomy by approaching contraceptive services with a reproductive justice lens. This includes implementing patient-centered contraceptive counseling, increasing access to LARC, eliminating barriers to LARC removal, and committing to systemic changes to address healthcare inequities. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Monuments are being taken down, flags are being redesigned, and institutions that honored those who denied the humanity of Black people are being renamed. Unfortunately for Sandra Bland, Breonna Taylor, Sha-Asia Washington and countless other Black transgender people including those with capacity for pregnancy, there was no justice even prior to the global pandemic of SARS-Cov-2 or coronavirus; namely racism, violence, and the Black Maternal Health crisis that makes it less likely that Black women will survive pregnancy and childbirth. The purpose of this article is to situate the state of Black people with the capacity for pregnancy in the context of these existing crises to illuminate the myths that racism has perpetuated through science, health services provision and policy. The greatest of these is the myth of a default human that can serve as a standard for the rest of the population. This racist ideal underpins education, provision of care, research, policies, and public health praxis. Demolishing the myth starts with acknowledging that Black people are not the architects of their own destruction: the default standard of whiteness is. The article begins with a historical background on how this myth came to be and elucidates the development and perpetuations of the myth of the default human. Next, we present an evidence based scoping review of the literature to summarize current thinking with specific focus on the Black maternal health crisis, we make policy recommendations and retrofits of upstream public health approaches for existing programs toward health equity. We also situate Black maternal health as part of a reproductive justice frame that centers Black women and birthing people's autonomy and agency. In other words, we use the scoping review to end with reimagining public health policy and provide an actionable roadmap to specifically disrupt the myth of the default human and dismantle racism in education, provision of care, research, policies, and public health praxis. © Copyright © 2021 Bray and McLemore.},

	abstract = {In this qualitative interview study, we took a two-pronged approach to understand the complexities of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) care access for Latinas in an emerging Latino community (ELC). Phase 1 assessed the SRH resources available for uninsured Latinas through provider interviews. In Phase 2, we interviewed 15 Latina-identified women about their considerations for SRH care-seeking. The scant options for SRH care are focused largely on contraception and pregnancy. Providers viewed themselves as prevention-oriented and perceived Latinas did not prioritize preventive care. Women described compounding challenges and precarious conditions. Annual checkups, accessing contraception, and treating vaginal infections were identified as needs. Barriers to SRH care were enhanced in an ELC. Participants described too much paperwork and limited time as organizational barriers which aggravated others, such as language limitations and feeling embarrassed to ask questions. Further research on SRH care using a reproductive justice approach is needed in ELCs. © The Author(s) 2021.},

	abstract = {Environmental reproductive justice is increasingly being utilized as a framework for exploring how environmental exploitation and pollution contribute to reproductive health and reproductive injustices. However, little research explores how settler colonialism and historical oppression contribute to the physical transformation of land, and how this undermines tribal members’ health. Even less research explores the intersection of environmental justice and reproductive justice among Indigenous groups, especially in the Gulf South, who are especially vulnerable to environmental justice issues due to climate change, land loss, and oil company exploitation, and for tribes that are non-federally recognized. A qualitative description research methodology was used to conduct 31 life-history interviews with women from a Gulf Coast Indigenous tribe. Findings of this study reveal that central components of reproductive justice, including the ability to have children and the ability to raise children in safe and healthy environments, are undermined by environmental justice issues in the community. Among concerns raised by women were high rates of chronic healthcare issues among community members, and issues with infertility. Recognizing Indigenous sovereignty is central to addressing these environmental reproductive justice issues. This research is unique in exploring the topic of environmental reproductive justice among a state-recognized Gulf Coast tribe. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Contemporary young feminists (in South Africa) are claiming and proclaiming reproductive agency, often through public social media discourses and popular activist sentiments. Key features are expressions of embodied warfare via the female reproductive organs, talk of an agentic uterus that periodically ‘tries to kill’ its host, and emphatic descriptions of violent modes of relation. This article aims to recognise that reproductive violences play out not only in the material inequities of everyday life and sexual and reproductive health/care, but also in the language practices of social collectivities, where discursive practices and norms can make or unmake, injure, negate and erase, or affirm and transform subjectivities. Proceeding from an examination of the discursive contexts in which dominant societal (hetero)norms may enact sexual and reproductive violences, I explore a broadened recognition of reproductive violence that engages with discursive arenas, namely the intimate public (Berlant 2008). My analysis shows that the discursive work done in the examined public is vital for feminist cultural production of new imaginaries of gendered and community life, and what it means to be co-imbricated in feminist social reproduction. I conclude the analysis with a gesture to feminist engagement on mutually desirable notions of reproductive justice while attending sufficiently to unexpected forms of reproductive violence. © 2021 E. de Ruiters.},

In the past decade, many of them come to speak openly about obstetric violence and to legitimize the right of women to narrate the suffering experienced, composing another paradigma of care, articulated to a conter-hegemonic reproductive pedagogy. From an intersectional view, we propose to think of the doulage associated with perinatal education as a practice of problematizing the more general cultural assumptions around which the current reproductive hierarchies and the hegemonic obstetric model are organized. We suggest that the present contribution makes it possible to broaden the debate on reproductive governance beyond the liberal foundation of the sexual and reproductive rights paradigm, in order to accommodate the premises of the struggle for reproductive justice. © 2021.

The pandemic has particularly affected populations who have been historically excluded by various forms of oppression and subjugation. The findings highlight the slackening of sexual and reproductive health care, which can result in unplanned pregnancy, unsafe abortion and maternal death, worsening the social conditions of a large segment of the population. By articulating the social markers of difference and the principle of social justice, it is argued that theoretical contributions from the field of black feminism, namely intersectionality and reproductive justice, can help understand social inequalities and promote collective resistance to the dismantling of the country’s health policies. © 2021, Fundacao UNI Botucatu/UNESP.

	abstract = {Background: Inequities in maternal mortality in the United States are a form of structural violence against Black women. The concept of reproductive justice has been employed in the social sciences for almost 30 years, yet nursing has been slow to adopt this concept in promoting maternal-child health. Objective: To analyze the concept of reproductive justice as used in peer-reviewed publications with the aim of reframing black maternal health in public health nursing scholarship, research, practice, and advocacy. Design: We conducted a systematic review of the social science literature. We analyzed selected articles though a principle-based concept analysis focusing on epistemological, pragmatic, linguistic, and logical principles. Sample: Eight articles were selected from a pool of 377. Results: Race was identified as a source of power for understanding reproductive justice through individual knowledge, collective knowledge, and praxis. Pragmatically, reproductive justice is a social justice-oriented platform that bridges the pro-choice/pro-life divide; aids coalition building; and promotes inclusion. Linguistically, the concept is distinct from both reproductive health and reproductive rights. Reproductive justice is logically situated within intersectionality theory and the cumulative embodiment of oppressions Black women experience based on race, class, and gender. Conclusion: Reproductive justice reframes public health nursing actions for Black women by focusing on uncovering systems of oppression, recognizing past historical injustices, and advancing cultural safety in health promotion. Multilevel interventions are needed to simultaneously address these injustices particularly in the areas of preconception health, maternal health, infant and child health, and Black family well-being across the reproductive lifespan. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) is a key component to the overall health and quality of life and is impacted by power inequities inherent to society's institutions, environment, economics, and culture. In Portugal, guidelines for intervention in SRH are insufficient, a gap that is more pronounced with migrant populations due to the absence of culturally sensitive indicators to assess and monitor SRH. The aim of this work was 2-fold: to identify good practices in the SRH field, with a particular focus, whenever possible, on migrant populations, and to identify relevant and inclusive indicators to monitor SRH in Portugal. A Delphi panel (via online survey) with 66 experts (researchers, teachers, and health professionals) and 16 stakeholders (non-governmental organizations, civil society, and governmental organizations) was implemented in two rounds. Panelists were asked to state their level of agreement (5-point Likert-type scale) regarding four different SRH areas: Sexual Health, Reproductive Health, Social-Structural Factors, and Good Practices. Items were based on literature review and a World Café with 15 experts and stakeholders. Participation rate was 68% and response rate was 97% on the first round. From the initial list of 142 items, a total of 118 (83%) items were approved by consensus. Findings may provide extended opportunities for the healthcare system to engage in better informed decisions and more inclusive and integrative strategies regarding SRH, contributing to build political measures toward sexual and reproductive justice. © Copyright © 2021 Candeias, Alarcão, Stefanovska-Petkovska, Santos, Virgolino, Pintassilgo, Pascoal, Costa and Machado.},

	abstract = {We revisit the debates on reproductive health and rights (RHR) and public policies in Brazil, with focus on contraception, abortion and maternity care. These were part of a broader political agenda for re-democratisation, and for health sector reform, with the creation of the Women’s Integral Health Program (PAISM) in 1983, and of the Universal Health System (SUS) in 1988. The momentum created by ICPD in Cairo (1994) was essential to institutionalise the language of RHR. Not without resistance and organised activism, recent years of right-wing governments brought a disinvestment in most public policies for women’s rights. Some components of the RHR agenda are more mainstreamed, such as fertility regulation, especially hormonal and long term-methods. The limited legal rights to abortion are poorly institutionalised and constantly threatened. Maternal care tends to be highly medicalised and frequently abusive. The covid-19 pandemic accelerated social and public health disruption. The article addresses notions such as reproductive justice and institutional violence, present in the early days of women’s health movement, in order to highlight important premises that were diluted in the debate on reproductive rights and autonomy. The historical analysis of how these concepts evolved locally and globally can allow a better understanding of present challenges. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Aim: People with diabetes have contraceptive needs that have been inadequately addressed. The aim of this qualitative study was to develop a theoretical model that reflects contraceptive decision-making and behaviour in the setting of diabetes mellitus. Methods: We conducted semi-structured, qualitative interviews of 17 women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes from Michigan, USA. Participants were recruited from a diabetes registry and local clinics. We adapted domains from the Health Belief Model (HBM) and applied reproductive justice principles to inform the qualitative data collection and analysis. Using an iterative coding template, we advanced from descriptive to theoretical codes, compared codes across characteristics of interest (e.g. diabetes type), and synthesized the theoretical codes and their relationships in an explanatory model. Results: The final model included the following constructs and themes: perceived barriers and benefits to contraceptive use (effects on blood sugar, risk of diabetes-related complications, improved quality of life); perceived seriousness of pregnancy (harm to self, harm to foetus or baby); perceived susceptibility to pregnancy risks (diabetes is a ‘high risk’ state); external cues to action (one-size-fits-all/anxiety-provoking counselling vs. personalized/trust-based counselling); internal cues to action (self-perceived ‘sickness’); self-efficacy (reproductive self-efficacy, contraceptive self-efficacy); and modifying factors (perceptions of biased counselling based upon one’s age, race or severity of disease). Conclusions: This novel adaptation of the HBM highlights the need for condition-specific and person-centred contraceptive counselling for those with diabetes. © 2020 Diabetes UK},

	abstract = {A neo-Malthusian reflex can be observed in the climate debate: statistical calculations link climate change to world population growth and suggest strategies for birth control. The undead neo-Malthusian ghost is being revived, with its reference to the category of ‘population’ and its colonial-racist and social-Darwinist legacies. This article discusses this dangerous development, paying particular but not exclusive attention to German constellations, showing that the actors who strengthen this narrative range from ecological mainstream positions to those right-wing forces who do not deny climate change. However, some climate activist and feminist positions have also contributed by advocating a birth strike as a strategy for containing climate change. The article analyses three dimensions of neo-Malthusianism: the abstract statistical construction of an excess population; the historically deeply rooted racist and classist attribution of this excess to ‘others’; and the totalitarian visions of global ‘fertility’ management. The argument is that even if the racist and classist attributions are not directly addressed by the more progressive political actors, the three dimensions of neo-Malthusianism strongly flow together and reinforce each other. In conclusion, the text takes up anti-Malthusian feminist perspectives which place a special emphasis on the concept of reproductive justice. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Scholars have often oscillated between celebrating the transformative potential of solidarity and recognising the ambivalent nature of cooperation for disadvantaged and marginalised groups. How can we make sense of these differences? This article addresses this question by unpacking intersectional solidarity along two dimensions: the ways issues are framed; and the extent to which organisations adopt a transformative praxis to redress disparities in resources and representation. By focusing on the interplay between discursive and material dimensions of power, we identify four types of intersectional solidarity, with different transformative potential. The usefulness of this typology is illustrated by means of secondary analysis of coalition work developed around reproductive justice and domestic workers’ rights. It shows that only an ideal form of transformative solidarity reflects feminist normative theorising of an alliance across differences. © European Conference on Politics and Gender and Bristol University Press 2021.},

	abstract = {Objectives From a reproductive justice framework, we aimed to investigate how a possible association between hormonal contraceptive (HC) and antidepressants use (as a proxy for depression) is distributed across intersectional strata in the population. We aimed to visualise how intersecting power dynamics may operate in combination with HC use to increase or decrease subsequent use of antidepressants. Our main hypothesis was that the previously observed association between HC and antidepressants use would vary between strata, being more pronounced in more oppressed intersectional contexts. For this purpose, we applied an intersectional multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy approach. Design Observational prospective cohort study using record linkage of national Swedish registers. Setting The population of Sweden. Participants All 915 954 women aged 12-30 residing in Sweden 2010, without a recent pregnancy and alive during the individual 1-year follow-up. Primary outcome measure Use of any antidepressant, meaning being dispensed at least one antidepressant (ATC: N06A) during follow-up. Results Previously mentally healthy HC users had an OR of 1.79 for use of antidepressants compared with non-users, whereas this number was 1.28 for women with previous mental health issues. The highest antidepressant use were uniformly found in strata with previous mental health issues, with highest usage in women aged 24-30 with no immigrant background, low income and HC use (51.4%). The largest difference in antidepressant use between HC users and non-users was found in teenagers, and in adult women of immigrant background with low income. Of the total individual variance in the latent propensity of using antidepressant 9.01% (healthy) and 8.16% (with previous mental health issues) was found at the intersectional stratum level. Conclusions Our study suggests teenagers and women with immigrant background and low income could be more sensitive to mood effects of HC, a heterogeneity important to consider moving forward.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.},

	abstract = {Can social media posts translate likes into votes? Can the right hashtag and filter create meaningful policy reforms? Will digital activism replace in-person protesting? What happens when the line between activist and influencer blur? While Twitter and Facebook receive the bulk of attention when it comes to social media influencing politics, Instagram is increasingly a site where users and organizations craft messaging and display their demands. From highly stylized selfies to tongue in cheek memes, politics are abundant on Instagram despite the platform's reputation for frivolity, decadence, and beauty. This chapter explores how social movement actors utilize Instagram to deliver complex political messages in beautiful and often humorous packages. Using data from Instagram projects, I provide an overview of how some organizations have embraced the platform and what that can tell us about digital political performances in general and the significance of Instagram specifically. My data consist of posts from Women's March official account, public posts using the hashtag "womensmarch," and posts from six reproductive justice organizations. I utilize mixed methods with exploratory and targeted content analyses, and an original 1,200 post quantitative dataset. I examine how social movement organizations perform politics and how those performances develop over time due to political changes or audience engagement. Conventional understandings of the platform might suggest that posts prioritize likes, positive or upbeat messaging, and visual aesthetics; however, I find that while some organizations adhere to convention, others prioritize their messaging over popularity. This paper first dives into the many methodological challenges and opportunities Instagram offers, then details two distinct but related cases of progressive movements, and finally ends with a discussion of the importance of understanding the political possibilities and dangers of the influence of social media on our political realities. © 2021 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

	abstract = {Objective: We examined if abortion-related knowledge among women with criminal legal system involvement differed in three U.S. cities in states with varying abortion policies. Study Design: Respondents were self-identified women with criminal legal system involvement. Data come from a cross-sectional baseline survey of 381 women in three U.S. cities: Oakland, California, Kansas City, Kansas/Missouri, and Birmingham, Alabama. The primary outcome, high abortion-related knowledge, was based on a 10-item scale dichotomized into low vs high abortion-related knowledge. We used descriptive statistics, bivariable associations, and logistic regression to assess the association between high abortion-related knowledge, city of residence, and other possible related factors. Results: Respondents in Kansas City, KS/MO and Birmingham, AL had lower odds of high abortion-related knowledge compared to respondents in Oakland, CA (OR: 0.19, 95% CI: 0.10–0.38 and OR: 0.17, 95% CI: 0.11–0.28, respectively). In adjusted analysis, the association remained after controlling for race/ethnicity, insurance status, and community supervision past year. Conclusions: Findings underscore the need for communicating clear and accurate information about abortion care, especially in states where laws and ongoing political challenges make it difficult to access both reliable information and services. Implications: Efforts to disseminate accurate information regarding abortion care, particularly among marginalized people, should utilize multiple venues in addition to traditional healthcare information sources. Reproductive justice advocates should connect with jails and probation offices to reach people with criminal legal system involvement and foster increased knowledge of reproductive rights and services. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Digital communication tools have become increasingly pivotal to facilitating the engagement and management of difficult health-related conversations. Peer conversations about individual women's experiences relating to the side effects of contraceptive use are not often held outside of medical contexts. To provoke conversations about birth control, on 9 January 2018, the Sexual and Reproductive Justice Coalition (SRJC) tweeted the results of a study about the severe side effects of using Depo-Provera (a contraceptive injection), triggering diverse discussions. This article reports on a study that analysed online narratives of tweets based on female experiences of effects suffered from contraceptive use and adopted a qualitative netnography design. Three theoretical perspectives, namely, the spiral of silence theory, the critical modernism theory, and the patient-centred model of health care, were relevant to the study. The results provided oft-unheard narratives of South African female voices on personal experiences and agency about contraceptive use. Within health communication, policymakers, as well as campaign designers, need to have a holistic understanding of the factors which may influence women's decisions to (dis)continue a contraceptive method. Such information is critical to designing interventions and programmes which will enable the achievement of important birth control goals and inform the design of effective policies or health campaign messaging. Online patient empowerment on various social media platforms needs to be monitored to avoid misinformation. © 2021 Unisa Press.},

	abstract = {The Nairobi Summit, held in November 2019 and convened by the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, claims to have represented “all nations and peoples, and all segments” of society during its high-level conference. The overall aim of the summit was to mobilize political will and financial commitments that are urgently needed to “finally and fully” implement the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) Program of Action. Despite the recommendation by ICPD to incorporate infertility care in reproductive health services, the new Nairobi Statement largely neglects the topic of infertility. This is particularly troublesome as infertility is a global health problem affecting between 52.6 and 72.4 million couples worldwide, with a high prevalence in low- and middle-income settings. For many people around the world, infertility constitutes an emotional, social, and financial burden, yet appropriate services directed toward preventing and addressing infertility are often inaccessible, unaffordable, or nonexistent. With the impetus of a wider reproductive justice community, we call for the integration of infertility into global reproductive health research and practice, urging policy makers, practitioners, researchers, activists, and funders worldwide to bring focused attention to addressing challenges posed by a lack of safe, effective, and dignified fertility management among those in need.

	abstract = {Public health discourses often claim that delaying pregnancy is associated with social and economic benefits. Yet research suggests that, for young people, structural inequity is most influential in future outcomes, regardless of childbearing. We conducted in-depth interviews with 50 young women (ages 18–24) and their male partners (n = 100) and investigated the influence of structural inequity on pregnancy desires and plans. Three themes emerged, stratified by social advantage. In the “Things Will Be Different Later” theme, socially advantaged participants envisioned that their future lives would surely be different due to achievement of educational, professional, and economic goals; thus, their pregnancy plans aligned with their desires, often reflected in use of highly effective contraception. In the “I Don’t Have Everything I Need” theme, participants expressed delaying desired pregnancies (primarily through condom use) until they could contend with structural barriers. Their pregnancy plans, shifted by way of structural inequity, were not aligned with their desires. Under the “I’ll Never Have Everything I Need” theme, socially disadvantaged participants expressed significant doubt about ever realizing ideal circumstances for pregnancy preparedness; as pregnancy prevention was not salient, these participants used condoms or no contraception. This analysis indicates that structural inequities constrain reproductive self-determination in emerging adulthood, creating a chasm between desired and actual childbearing that was reflected in contraceptive decision-making. Public health narratives emphasizing the importance of pregnancy prevention for socially disadvantaged groups without addressing the manifestation of structural inequity in their lives perpetuate reproductive oppression vis-à-vis emphasis on contraceptive use to ensure future economic success. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Despite declining rates of pregnancy-related deaths worldwide, the United States (US) has seen an increase in maternal mortality. It is widely known that this increased risk of mortality impacts unevenly Black people, who are three-fold more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white people. This disparity in maternal mortality and morbidity is not unique to the US; countries like Brazil, the Netherlands, South Africa, and the United Kingdom (UK) report similar racial disparities in peripartum health outcomes. It is thought that many factors contribute to this tragic health inequity, including, but not limited to, structural racism, provider implicit bias, and lack of access to high quality, culturally humble reproductive health care. On July 25, 2020, activists for reproductive justice and birth justice published an open call in the New York Times entitled “How many Black, Brown, and Indigenous people have to die giving birth? National call for birth justice and accountability.” It is a powerful statement that uses an intersectional framework to understand reproductive inequities, while making demands for positive healthcare reforms and radically dreaming of a reality where the struggle for reproductive justice has been actualized. Using personal narrative, this paper reflects on the field of obstetric anesthesiology and how clinicians can make meaningful change to address and eventually help solve this health care inequity. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

The field of psychology has culpability in creating and maintaining dominant narratives that have served to justify the dehumanization of marginalized groups, particularly in regards to the methodologies used. Meaningfully integrating reproductive justice (RJ) frameworks into psychological science can drive the development of interventions for using empiricism in the service of justice for systemically vulnerable groups. This paper examines how RJ offers psychological science methodological interventions that interrogate, expose, and challenge hegemonic discourses and policies that have functioned to disempower systemically vulnerable groups. © 2020 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues},

However, the question of caste has received little attention in the literature and there has been a lack of research on assisted reproductive technologies and caste along with the absence of Dalit feminists speaking out on reproductive technologies. This paper attempts to begin exploring the significance of caste by drawing on in-depth interviews with Dalit feminists who challenge dominant understandings of surrogacy in both international and national debates on reproductive technologies. It highlights how an insistence on the wider socio-economic context of women's lives challenges notions of reproductive rights, replacing them by reproductive justice. © 2020 Economic and Political Weekly.

Using an ethnographic approach rooted in Reproductive Justice, we conducted six focus groups that included 66 resettled Somali and Congolese women in a western United States (US) metropolitan area. We analyzed data using modified grounded theory. Three themes emerged within the family planning domain: (a) concepts of family, (b) fertility management, and (c) unintended pregnancy. We contextualized these themes within existing frameworks for refugee cultural transition under the analytic paradigms of “pronatalism and stable versus evolving family structure” and “active versus passive engagement with family planning.” Provision of just and equitable family planning care to resettled refugee women requires understanding cultural relativism, social determinants of health, and how lived experiences influence family planning conceptualization. We suggest a counseling approach and provider practice recommendations based on our study findings. © The Author(s) 2019.},

	abstract = {Saving Delaney is one of a number of “special needs” parent memoirs published in the United States since 2000 and is the only memoir about raising a disabled child in the United States written by lesbian parents. Like many representations of disability, “special needs” parent memoirs use a problematic narrative in which the presumed negative effects of disability are individually overcome before life lived happily ever after. Also like popular and positive representations of disability, the children subjects of “special needs” parent memoirs are almost entirely white. In this paper, I contextualize Saving Delaney within histories of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) family-making in the United States, drawing particular attention to the overrepresentation of children with disabilities among gay and lesbian adoptive parent households. Then, drawing attention to the overwhelming whiteness of both positive portrayals of children with disabilities in “special needs” parent memoirs and LGBT families in scholarship, data, and media, I argue that white privilege facilitates visibility and protection against disability stigmas. I demonstrate that LGBT family-making and caring for children with disabilities cohere as issues of comprehensive reproductive justice and that narratives like Delaney’s fail to advance the reproductive justice movement due to reiterative entrenchment in the material and discursive privileges of whiteness. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

We identify LARC promotion discourse as constituting ‘The Age of LARC’: multifarious strategies for producing responsible sexual citizens whose health behaviours are empowered via a LARC-only approach to contraceptive use. We suggest that immediate postpartum LARC insertion policies, which have proliferated in the U.S. since 2012, exemplify the new era of LARC hegemony, in which urgency, efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and outcomes dominate both health policy and clinical practice around these contraceptive technologies. By following these efforts to facilitate access to and use of immediate postpartum LARC, we find a discourse on sexual citizenship that paradoxically constructs sexual health freedom through the use of a single class of contraceptive technologies. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

In Johanna Schoen's history of sterilization, she shows how medical researchers, public health practitioners, and sometimes family members charged that women's "sexual delinquency" demonstrated their "feeblemindedness" and justified compulsory sterilization. Women were most often sterilized when they interacted with medical personnel in settings in which they sought healthcare, including nonpermanent forms of birth control. White women's demands for voluntary sterilization accompanied calls for access to other forms of reliable and safe contraception and legal abortion. The term "reproductive justice" implicitly critiqued calls for "reproductive choice," voiced by mostly white feminists.

	abstract = {Irish legislative engagement with abortion law reform has never been framed by recognition of the rights of pregnant women, girls and other people. Rather, where it has taken place at all, it has always been foetocentric and punitive, exceptionalising abortion and conceptualising law as a means of discouraging it. In important ways, the post-repeal landscape has failed to break decisively with this orientation. While in 2018 there was certainly more discussion of women’s entitlement not to be exiled from the country in order to make decisions about reproduction, the framing that dominated legislative and government discourses of abortion law reform was one in which the ‘problem’ being addressed was such that unsafe medication, exclusion from formal medical systems, and the undeserved punishment of people who had received diagnoses of fatal foetal conditions in the course of their ‘much wanted pregnancies’ were the focus. There was little or no engagement in legislative politics with the right to choose, reproductive agency, reproductive justice or the moral standing of pregnant people as ethical decision makers when it came to their pregnancies. As a result, post-repeal abortion law reform was more about managing risk than maximising agency. I will argue that this underpins and partly explains the shortcomings of the new law: the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 (‘HRTPA 2018’). Within that new legal regime, I argue, pregnant people continue to lack decisional security when it comes to their reproductive lives and are exposed to significant constitutional and dignitary harms as a result. © 2020 The Author(s).},

This is the largest study of pregnancy outcomes and associated factors among girls impacted by CSE in the United States. Methods: We reviewed court files of participants in a juvenile specialty court for youth impacted by CSE, between 2012 and 2016. We collected data on pregnancy, health, and social factors. Data were updated through 2018 and descriptive statistics were calculated. Two-sample tests for equality of proportions explored associations between pregnancy with adverse childhood experiences and the girls’ behavioral health profiles. Results: Among the 360 biological females, 31% had ever been pregnant. Of the girls ever pregnant, 18% had multiple pregnancies. Outcomes for the 130 reported pregnancies were: 76% live births; 13% therapeutic abortions; 5% miscarriages or stillbirths; and 6% of pregnancies were ongoing at case closure. Parental incarceration and histories of maternal substance abuse were both associated with pregnancy. Conclusions: High pregnancy rates among girls with histories of CSE suggest the importance of applying a reproductive justice approach to deliver reproductive education, family planning services, prenatal care, and parenting support to girls impacted by CSE. © 2019 Academic Pediatric Association},

In this article—the first to analyze anti–crisis pregnancy center activism—we draw from End Fake Clinics’ work to outline the contours of what a queer reproductive justice politic might entail. Through archiving and analyzing End Fake Clinics’ Queering Reproductive Justice workshop, we argue that approaching abortion as a form of gender transgression allows us to recognize deeper connections between queer and reproductive issues, as well as to complicate this very distinction. In the case of End Fake Clinics, creating a queer reproductive justice politic was enabled, we argue, by the deep affective connections developed through the group as well as by participants’ collective belief that their activism would be best when informed by feminist and queer theory. In discussing what we describe as End Fake Clinics’ epistemologically based and affectively bound activism, we expand on the limited feminist scholarship on crisis pregnancy centers and queer theoretical scholarship on reproduction, putting these bodies of thought into conversation in new ways. As reproductive justice activists and scholars have begun to use the phrase “queering reproductive justice” to refer to the reproductive concerns of LGBTQ people, and as increasing numbers of LGBTQ people engage in reproduction, End Fake Clinics provides us with more complicated ways to approach queering reproductive justice beyond such identitarian models. © 2020 by The University of Chicago.

	abstract = {This paper contextualizes the struggles and contributions of Black motherhood and reproductive justice under police surveillance in Baltimore, Maryland. We conducted semi-structured interviews with mothers regarding their experiences and perceptions of policing in their community during the aftermath of the police-involved death of Freddie Gray. While the literature disproportionately focuses on Black males, little knowledge is known about the struggles and contributions of Black mothers in matters concerning police brutality and the fight against institutional violence. There still remains the question regarding the role of and impact on Black mothers during matters of institutional violence against Black children. We fill this gap by highlighting narratives and lived knowledges within a Black motherhood perspective. Primary themes show that Black women are subject to terror from police and system agents, they face reproductive justice issues, as they are criminalized as mothers—and are affected mentally, but they employ various resistance strategies that strengthen their resilience. Results indicate that Black women are the backbone and martyrs of their communities, but this comes at a tremendous cost because they remain largely unprotected and subject to immeasurable institutional violence and judgment against their mothering strategies. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {The Handmaid's Tale (1985), by Canadian author Margaret Atwood, features a reproductive dystopia called the Republic of Gilead that is set in a near-futuristic USA. However compelling, the association of the novel with the politics of abortion in the era of President Donald J. Trump has sidelined its temporal origins in the first term of Ronald Reagan's presidency and overshadowed the plot's hinge: a fertility decline triggered mainly by a series of ecological crises leads to the founding of the Republic of Gilead as a white supremacist, patriarchal, evangelical Christian, theocratic stronghold bent on improving the white birth rate. This backdrop is indebted to Atwood's own longstanding ecofeminist philosophy, which means that the novel is as much about Reagan. Approaching the novel along these parallel tracks provides ample opportunity to spotlight its real-life historical context, using it as a springboard to examine the plot's racial implications and the knock-on emergence of movements for environmental justice and reproductive justice, coming full circle to the Trump era. © 2020},

	abstract = {This text is an introduction to my doctoral creative research2 that addresses issues of women’s rights and reproductive justice in Ecuador and Latin America, through the practice of the screenplay writing. The basic research questions that allow me to articulate this reflection are: is it possible to set on legal grounds a fictional story about women’s reproductive rights, in order to propose a political argumentation about women’s fundamental rights and reproductive justice issues in Ecuador and Latin America? If it is, could that fiction in anyway question and contest the legislation in force in order to re-right the rights law disregarded? Through a feature-length screenplay and accompanying dissertation, artistic practice-led research interrogates several international human rights instruments, Constitutional law, Criminal Law and public policy in Ecuador, with regards to women’s reproductive rights. The screenplay is the outcome of a particular sort of juridical hermeneutics; where the heuristic force Paul Ricœur recognizes in fiction allows the screenplay writer to re-present various juridical fictions regarding reproductive rights, shaped according to the Ecuadorian law, in the form of four female characters. The research proposes a biopolitical trajectory in order to interrogate life as possibility, potentiality, and a female body as Bare Life. Dissenting fictions re-righting law renders visible how Ecuadorian law and its biopolitical enforcement strategies disenfranchise women. It ultimately introduces dissensus, as suggested by Jacques Rancière, as a tactic to re-right those rights law disregarded. © 2020, Universidad Andina Simon Olivar, Sede Ecuador.

The first two studies were undertaken concurrently given the dearth of research on the topic in the Australian context, and the third study was then undertaken given a primary focus on healthcare professionals in responses to the first two studies. For the present article, a deductive thematic analysis framed by a reproductive justice lens was undertaken on qualitative data from each study. Findings from the first study suggest that while some parents may be supportive of their child's reproductive wishes, other parents may insist upon their child undertaking fertility preservation. In the second study, transgender and non-binary adults emphasized that gamete retrieval may be framed in cisgenderist ways by healthcare professionals, and that professionals may endorse pronatalism. Finally, healthcare professionals reported normative views about gamete retrieval and framed fertility preservation as an “insurance policy.” This article concludes by considering what the findings have to suggest for the continued development of trans reproductive justice. © 2019 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues},

The purpose of this study was to utilize a reproductive justice framework in which reproduction is considered a woman-centered experience (as opposed to a social issue to be solved) to understand the reproductive experiences of women in South Carolina. We conducted 70 in-depth interviews with women aged 19–78 years and analyzed these interviews using a constant comparative method. Study findings revealed that participants faced the consequences of oppressive systems of power when accessing reproductive health care, including high costs and lack of adequate health insurance coverage. Participants recognized the complexity of navigating reproduction in a conservative social context (i.e., South Carolina), further “compounded” by their gender and race. Women of color specifically noted challenges to reproductive care based on historical injustices and discrimination, including racial bias in hospital settings and aversion to certain contraceptive methods (e.g., IUD). Participants described the need to exercise reproductive autonomy and to have a “voice” in order to make desired lifestyle choices (e.g., career, motherhood) to overcome these challenges. Study findings evidence the women-centered experience of reproduction within a specific sociogeopolitical context in order to uncover the challenges and opportunities to improving women's reproductive health in South Carolina. © 2020 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues},

	abstract = {Public abortion attitudes are important predictors of abortion stigma and accessibility, even in legal settings like the U.S. and South Africa. With data from the U.S. General Social Survey and South African Social Attitudes Survey, we used ordinal logistic regressions to measure whether abortion acceptability (in cases of poverty and fetal anomaly) is related to attitudes about social welfare programs and gender roles, then assessed differences by race/ethnicity and education. Social welfare program attitudes did not correlate with abortion acceptability in the U.S., but in South Africa, greater support for income equalization (OR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.41–0.85) and increased government spending on the poor (OR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.49–0.91) correlated with lower abortion acceptability in circumstances of poverty. This was significant for Black African and higher educated South Africans. In the U.S., egalitarian gender role attitudes correlated with higher acceptability of abortion in circumstances of poverty (OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.03–1.36) and fetal anomaly (OR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.01–1.31). This was significant for White and less educated Americans. In South Africa, egalitarian gender role attitudes correlated with higher abortion acceptability for fetal anomaly (OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.01–1.25) overall and among Black and less educated respondents, but among non-Black South Africans they correlated with higher abortion acceptability in circumstances of poverty. These results suggest abortion attitudes are distinctly related to socioeconomic and gender ideology depending one’s national context, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Reducing abortion stigma will require community-based approaches rooted in intersectional reproductive justice frameworks. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The current study uses a reproductive justice framework to examine how a community-based organization led by a group of women in rural Nicaragua challenges gendered psychosocial processes related to women's rights violations. In partnership with a grassroots local organization, we used structural equation modeling to demonstrate, in a sample of almost 300 women, that organizational participation was positively related to women's reproductive decision-making and educational aspiration, in part due to relationships with women's self-esteem and sense of powerlessness in sociopolitical matters. Given the persistent role of gendered inequities in the reproductive decision-making and educational aspirations of girls and women, considering the social-structural contexts that enable or limit rights is imperative to creating viable routes to gender justice. © 2020 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues},

	abstract = {The immediate postpartum period is a favorable, safe, and effective time to provide long-acting reversible contraceptives, yet it is not available widely. We describe an innovative hospital-based approach to immediate postpartum long-acting reversible contraceptives that includes (1) an emphasis on multidisciplinary teambuilding and identification of champions, (2) a focus on the use of implementation science at every stage of the process to develop a systematic and replicable strategy, and (3) an imperative to apply a reproductive justice framework to immediate postpartum long-acting reversible contraceptive implementation. Our model was developed with the use of implementation science best practices. Implementation teams comprised of diverse stakeholders were formed and included champions to promote progress. Our team assessed the implementation context for immediate postpartum long-acting reversible contraceptives and used the findings to develop a readiness assessment for hospitals. A stage-based implementation checklist was then developed to outline necessary infrastructure to support an immediate postpartum long-acting reversible contraceptive initiative. A reproductive justice lens guided planning and implementation. The 3 innovative aspects of our implementation process resulted in a systematic, multidisciplinary, and culturally appropriate model for immediate postpartum long-acting reversible contraceptives that can be replicated across hospitals. Implementation teams and champions moved the work forward at each hospital, and 3 of the 5 participating hospitals moved beyond the exploration stage of implementation during the engagement. Patient education materials and provider training incorporated person-centered and reproductive justice frameworks. Our hope is to continue to partner with stakeholders to better understand how our efforts to support hospital provision of immediate postpartum long-acting reversible contraceptives can increase reproductive health equity rather than perpetuate disparity. © 2019},

The qualifications for coverage, extent of coverage, and exemptions vary drastically from one state to another, resulting in deficiencies in access to care even within mandated states for certain groups, such as single individuals, patients in same-sex relationships, and patients pursuing fertility preservation. Although insurance coverage of fertility services in the United States has expanded as an increasing number of states have enacted infertility mandates, significant gaps in implementation and access remain even among states with existing mandates.

Contextual understanding of sexual decision making is vital for effective engagement by sexual and reproductive health service providers with communities. An intersectional reproductive justice approach broadens the sexual rights lens allowing for an examination of multi-system factors impacting on sexual rights and health. Using the Matrix of Domination as a conceptual framework, we explored Timorese perceptions around decisions to have sex, and examined intersecting systems of oppression impacting on these decisions. Our study adopted a critical medical anthropological approach using ethnographic methods. A decolonising methodology aimed to make Timorese worldviews central to the analysis. Nine focus group discussions with 80 men and 17 individual reproductive history interviews with women were held in 4 of Timor-Leste’s 13 municipalities during October 2015. Findings suggest that decisions to have sex are framed in terms of wishes and rights; however, it was the perceived entitlements of men that were prioritised and predominantly men who made these decisions. Violence, coercion and unwanted pregnancies were linked to decisions about sex, and identified as potential consequences for women, impacting on women’s health and sexual rights. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

While practical guidance for facilitating critical social analysis exists, there is a need for empirical work exploring educator and participant experiences. To understand how urban educators implement critical social analysis and how participants experience it, reflective interviews were conducted with adult leaders and former youth organizers in Teen Advocates for Sexual Health. In a highly-segregated midwestern city, leaders engaged diverse youth in critical social analysis and social action around access to comprehensive school-based sexual health education. Three empowering interpersonal processes supported critical conversations on power, privilege, and sexual health. First, adult leaders established norms for power sharing and group communication. Second, leaders helped youth distinguish between feeling uncomfortable, integral to social justice learning, and feeling emotionally unsafe. Third, leaders supported emotional safety, allowing youth to determine their level of participation. Youth were empowered to remain engaged when uncomfortable, take action if they felt unsafe, and share responsibility for community safety. Combined with other organizing experiences, critical social analysis empowered participants as teens and contributed to adult social justice commitments. Findings contribute to literature on how urban educators can support sociopolitical development across settings. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Feminists witness legal worlds as they observe, document and share nothing less than the reproduction of life itself. The world of the abortion trail, where people and things move across borders to change life’s reproduction, has generated a rich variety of legal sources, figures and objects for feminist witnessing. In watching how feminist activists improvise with sources, figures and objects of legal consciousness on the abortion trail, this article seeks to contribute to critical understanding of a plurality of witnessing practice, particularly as it emerges in diaspora space. Focusing on Murphy’s concept of immodest witnessing, with its attention to bodies, protocols and apparatuses as constituents of knowledge, the article thinks with the diasporic feminist performance group, Speaking of I.M.E.L.D.A., about how they used self-examination, collaboration and knowledge-sharing on the trail to repeal Ireland’s 8th Amendment. The article argues that their improvisation with legal consciousness of reproductive choice enacts ‘cheeky witnessing’. Cheeky witnessing has three dynamics as a method of observation. First, it is messy and irreverent in innovating with names to display the mixed genealogies of feminist knowledge. Second, cheeky witnessing generates novel subject-figures who make connections between different reproductive labourers as observers of the trail in diaspora space. Third, cheeky witnessing places funny objects, knickers in this instance, so as to join up particular public locations and make them more, if unevenly, comfortable for sexual and reproductive bodies. Cheeky witnessing shows us how committed and partial practices play a role in speaking across interests and experiences, in stretching the legal imagination and in sustaining the everyday grind of making a better world. © 2020 The Author(s).},

Yet, formal models of pregnancy decision-making are uncommon and rarely incorporate cultural perspectives. In order to address this gap in the literature, we propose the Pregnancy Decision-Making Model (PDMM), a comprehensive model of the factors that are likely to affect pregnancy decisions in the context of unintended pregnancy, with special attention to relational and intersectional components of pregnancy decisions. The PDMM begins with three primary Evaluation factors: Evaluation of Capital, Evaluation of Values, and Evaluation of Narratives. Barriers to Access are proposed to be a key factor in limiting agency and autonomy and determining pregnancy outcomes. Social Influences are also hypothesized to influence Evaluation factors and their relationship with outcome variables, which include the Pregnancy Outcome, Decisional Certainty, and Decisional Satisfaction. As the PDMM is designed to be flexible in its prediction of a variety of outcomes, we consider a number of possible permutations of the model. Finally, we discuss the utility of the PDMM for inspiring future research, as well as the practical implications of the model. © The Author(s) 2020.},

In this study, we examined young adult Indian women's attitudes toward domestic violence DV help seeking behaviors using a reproductive justice framework. A total of 81 young adult women age 18–24 from Mysore, India, participated via in-depth qualitative focus groups. Findings suggested that informal familial systems and gender-focused formal support systems were viewed as the most acceptable networks for disclosing DV victimization. Women's organizations emerged as the second most appropriate network, particularly when it was deemed that an escalated response to DV victimization was needed. If the DV was perceived as severe or escalating, seeking judicial support was deemed appropriate. However, there were several cultural barriers that informed the women's perceptions of these systems effectiveness, including cultural beliefs about privacy, gender roles, and prior experiences. These results highlight the importance of addressing the multilevel cultural processes that serve to both facilitate and limit young adult Indian women's ability to address DV victimization. In contrast to the popular perception of abused women as passive victims, these women's assertions valuing empowerment highlight culturally specific responses to effectively addressing DV. © 2020 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues},

We focus on the Canadian case, examining the 2.5-year detention of a refugee claimant who was detained while 3 months pregnant. In line with feminist intersectional and critical migration scholars, we argue that immigration detention is a form of structural violence against non-citizens that is gendered, raced, and classed. However, our analytical framework extends existing scholarship by centring reproductive justice as a key axis along which the structural violence of non-citizenship is enacted. Our findings are thus critical of reforms to detention that frame pregnant women as biologically vulnerable: we instead argue for a structural understanding of vulnerability that centres reproductive justice as a fundamental component of migrant justice in envisioning a decarceral future. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

But the case adds one other dimension that distinguishes it from conventional reproductive justice cases: it presents a conflict between the rights of an American Indian parent and/or Indian tribe versus non-Indian adoptive parents to raise an Indian child. Central to the resolution of this Indian versus non-Indian parent conflict is an understanding of the purpose of the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), which created substantive and procedural protections to prevent the break-up of the Indian family. © Kimberly M.

Pregnancy-associated deaths are rising in the USA and are higher than in other developed nations. Pregnancy-associated mortality rates are disproportionately higher among non-Hispanic black women. The purpose of this paper is to (1) review the current literature regarding pregnancy-associated cardiovascular disease prevalence in black women compared with women of other races/ethnicities, (2) review proposed factors contributing to these health disparities, and (3) discuss potential avenues to address these disparities in the name of reproductive justice. Recent Findings: There is a paucity of data regarding factors contributing to disparities in health among black pregnant women, but it is clear that these cannot be fully explained by differences in socioeconomic backgrounds, access to health insurance, or healthcare literacy. Additionally, although some cardiovascular-related pregnancy mortality etiologies such as hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are decreasing in incidence, other pregnancy-associated cardiovascular diseases and cardiomyopathy rates are increasing. Although the pathophysiology behind peripartum cardiomyopathy is still unclear, its prevalence is high among black women. Studies are lacking probing the influence of psychosocial factors on patient-provider relationships and patient-centered decision-making among black women during pregnancy and postpartum. Summary: Black women disproportionately experience higher pregnancy-related cardiovascular morbidity and mortality compared with white women. More studies are needed to fill the gap in the literature data regarding the causes of this significant health disparity. A better understanding of the various factors driving these maternal health disparities could inform the development of holistic, multifaceted approaches to caring for black women in pregnancy and postpartum. Continued dialog—among healthcare professionals, patients, and their allies—is important to promote advocacy and to improve patient-provider relationships. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Data are reviewed to reveal the impact of gender on the lives of women—notably the devaluation of work done by women, particularly if the work is deemed feminist. Afterward, recent data on the persistence of both sexism and racism in our field are reviewed. Despite gains made by women (notably in the membership of the field), the highest positions in our professional association are held by men, particularly by White men. Data on the importance of reproductive rights to women are then considered, notably the fact that nearly one third of women will need abortion services by the time they reach middle age. Finally, I review recent efforts by conservatives to recriminalize abortion, specifically through the passage of laws making abortion difficult to arrange, or even outlawing the provision of abortion services.

	abstract = {Contemporary concern about climate change has been accompanied by a resurgence in questions about what part human numbers play in environmental degradation and species loss. What does population mean, and how is this concept being put to use at a moment when the urgency of climate change seems to elevate the appeal to/of numbers? What role has and should kinship play in understanding "population"? Through a discussion of three recent books-Adele Clarke and Donna Haraway's edited collection Making Kin Not Population, Michelle Murphy's The Economization of Life, and Jade Sasser's On Infertile Ground-this book review essay grapples with the place of human numbers in our understanding of the connections between human reproduction, kinship, and environmental issues. This essay engages most closely with the chapters by Clarke and Haraway in Making Kin, setting out concerns about their turn to (over)population through the analytical insights, historical perspectives, and empirical data of Murphy and Sasser. By putting these three books in dialogue with one another, this essay argues that responsibility for limitations on one's ability to make kin lies within a heteronormative, White supremacist, capitalist political-economy and its inherent structures of inequality rather than in individual (decision) making. © 2020 Duke University Press.

	abstract = {In the United States, between 1907 and 1978, the proliferation of eugenic state practices routinely targeted institutionalized women with legalized involuntary sterilization. Sterilization laws and policies were a form of reproductive control, which predominantly impacted women from marginalized communities. After the implementation of federal regulations prohibiting involuntary sterilization practices, state agencies continued to engage in coercive sterilization under the guise of “voluntariness.” Using a reproductive justice framework, we introduce a concept of reproductive control embedded within the carceral state. Tracing historical sterilization practices and examining the use of long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC), we argue that LARC represents a different form of involuntary sterilization. The emergence of LARC as a highly effective, nonagentive, and mediated form of contraception for vulnerable populations demands interrogation. We identify the use of LARC as soft sterilization, which is both related to and distinct from other forms of reproductive control. As such, reproductive autonomy is not possible without the destruction of the carceral state. © The Author(s) 2019.},

Invoking an intersectional lens, this paper examines how these discursive dynamics differentiate across social class in the Global South context of the Philippines. Utilizing a novel mixed methods strategy, we triangulate quantitative findings from a Q sort task and qualitative accounts of pregnancy resolution to identify classed discourses of reproductive agency as (a) reclaiming maternal virtue and (b) asserting autonomous choice. Statistical analysis reveals significant discursive divergence across class, wherein working-class women primarily adopt maternal virtue discourses while middle-class women disproportionately subscribe to autonomous choice. Interpretative analysis of women’s accounts complicates this bifurcated characterization by surfacing the diverse ways by which women negotiate both discourses in narratives of abortion and carrying to term. We discuss our contributions to the literature in terms of multilevel theoretical engagement with classed complexity in gendered issues like reproductive agency as well as innovating mixed methods in intersectional research.

This article argues that it is critical for social work to advance reproductive justice to truly achieve the grand challenge of closing the health gap. The article starts by discussing the history and tenets of reproductive justice and how it overlaps with social work ethics. The authors then highlight some of the ways by which social workers have been disruptors of and complicit in the oppression of individuals, families, and communities with regard to their reproductive rights and outcomes.

Phase 1 (baseline) data from an NIH funded study were used to examine rates of contraceptive use, reasons for nonuse of condoms, and correlates of condom use. Results indicate that the majority (96.5%) of respondents reported lifetime use of contraceptives, and most (70.5%) had a history of using multiple methods, with male condoms, oral contraceptive pills, and contraceptive injections being the most commonly used methods. Almost 69% of respondents reported nonuse of contraceptives within the last six months, despite high rates of involvement in risky, intimate male partnerships prior to incarceration. Contraceptive use was found to be historically acceptable in this sample, in stark contrast to rates of use within the last six months prior to incarceration, suggesting that reproductive justice-informed, social work interventions to help improve current contraceptive use are warranted as a harm-reduction approach. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis.},

Because arguments for later abortion rights have implications for all women’s reproductive lives, we approach these narratives from a critical perspective rooted in intersectional feminist theory and praxis and reproductive justice. We argue that the narratives develop an idealist rhetoric of self-sacrificing maternity that emerges from an orchestration of racialized discourses of good motherhood and the gendered liberal political tradition. Later abortion narratives limit women’s reproductive freedom by constructing a motivational vocabulary for understanding (and supporting) later abortions based on mercy and good motherhood. © 2021 National Communication Association.},

Recognizing that the current millennium welcomed new ways to view sexual and reproductive health issues, the chapter then lays out examples of trends in the US and internationally that have emerged since 2000. Two main areas of focus are “hashtag activism,” both domestically and beyond, and emerging topics like sexuality introduced by dynamic youth groups. In considering the accomplishments of earlier movements, the chapter describes progress on birth control, legalized abortion, curbed abuse of sterilization, and attention to infertility.

	abstract = {Aim: To present a protocol study directed at tackling gender discrimination against Roma girls by empowering their mattering so they can envision their own futures and choose motherhood only if—and when—they are ready. Background: Motherhood among Roma girls (RGM) in Europe impoverishes their lives, puts them at risk of poor physical and mental health and precipitates school dropouts. Overwhelming evidence affirms that the conditions of poverty and the social exclusionary processes they suffer have a very important explanatory weight in their sexual and reproductive decisions. Methods: Through a Community-based Participatory Action Research design, 20–25 Roma girls will be recruited in each one of the four impoverished communities in Bulgaria, Romania and Spain. Data collection and analysis: Desk review about scientific evidences and policies will be carried out to frame the problem. Narratives of Roma women as well as baseline and end line interviews of girl participants will be collected through both qualitative and quantitative techniques. Quantitative data will be gathered through reliable scales of mattering, socio–political agency, satisfaction with life and self. A narrative analysis of the qualitative information generated in the interviews will be carried out. Expected results: (1) uncover contextual and psychosocial patterns of girl-motherhood among Roma women; (2) build critical thinking among Roma girls to actively participate in all decisions affecting them and advocate for their own gender rights within their communities; and (3) empower Roma girls and their significant adults to critically evaluate their own initiatives and provide feedback to their relevant stakeholders. Conclusions: Roma girls will improve their educational aspirations and achievements and their social status while respecting and enhancing Roma values. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {According to the Spanish law of assisted reproduction, women intending to donate eggs must be “in good psychophysical health” and “do not suffer from genetic or infectious hereditary diseases transmissible to the offspring” (chapter II, article 5). What a “good” psychophysical health condition is, what the “transmissible diseases” are, and what counts as disease at all remains contested. In this paper, we explore how these broad legal criteria materialize through different tests and selection procedures. Drawing on extensive ethnographic fieldwork in Spanish fertility clinics and with egg donors in Spain, we argue that selection and management procedures are organized to split egg donors as “multiple bodies” (Mol 2002), which will have to be tamed in different ways. On the one hand, we will refer to the making of a “biographical subject,” for which we understand the donor to be a conscious autonomous subject. And on the other hand, we refer to the “body object,” for which we understand the donor to be a terrain of potential extractability. As we argue, clinics aim to select a responsible biographical subject who kindly obeys professionals’ instructions throughout the process in order to make the body object accessible to clinics’ extraction purposes. To conclude, our paper sheds light on issues of “reproductive in/justice” by discussing how the reproductive rights of intended parents through egg donation are entangled with inequalities of egg donors. © 2020 The Author(s).

This study explored women’s attitudes toward OC OTC in rural South Carolina. In-depth, individual interviews were conducted with 52 women ages 18–44 years old. Data analysis was informed by a reproductive justice theoretical framework and included an inductive, constant-comparative approach using HyperRESEARCH 3.7.5. Participants self-identified as either Black (62%) or White (28%). Participants believed that OC OTC would prevent unintended pregnancy by improving anonymity, convenience, and access to contraception. Many participants faced barriers to receiving a prescription, including time, transportation, cost, stigma, embarrassment, and clinician refusal based on religious reasons. Participants believed OC OTC would improve women’s control over their fertility and emphasized the importance of health insurance coverage for OC OTC. Some participants expressed concerns about the risk of side effects, contraindications, and the potential for abuse. Some participants believed women, especially adolescents, required physician guidance and an annual exam to use OC. Findings suggest that a lack of knowledge and misinformation about the risks of OC serve as a barrier among some women in rural areas. Widespread acceptance of OC OTC will require messaging strategies to dispel safety concerns about OC OTC and empower women. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Background: A growing body of work focuses on transgender reproductive justice. However, little research has been undertaken on trans activists’ contributions to reproductive justice movements in general, or to abortion rights movements in particular. Countries where trans identities are depathologized, such as Argentina, provide a unique opportunity to study challenges, achievements, and demands around reproductive justice for trans individuals in contexts where reproductive trans bodies are enabled to exist and may obtain legal gender recognition. Aims: To explore critical interventions by trans and travesti activists and organizations in Argentina around the issue of abortion rights. Methods: This paper analyses public speeches, publications, artwork, and flyers by trans and travesti activists and organizations in Argentina. Results: Trans contributions to abortion rights struggles have established common ground between trans and feminist/women’s movements around reproductive justice, have negotiated the inclusion of trans masculine persons within the abortion rights movement (both as activists and as potential users of abortion services), and have pointed to the country’s depathologized Gender Identity Law as a potential model for abortion regulations. Discussion: This paper concludes by discussing trans and travesti activists’ contributions to framing abortion rights within a wider social and political agenda at the intersection between health, gender, sexuality, and bodily autonomy, which furthers the work done by reproductive justice perspectives. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

The works stems from an obligation to shift my gaze to myself, as I follow a long reflexive tradition in feminist anthropology around exploring my vulnerabilities and changing point of view. I argue that queering reproductive justice reveals diverse forms of kinship and care networks to motivate coalition building across families. Queer Black activists and feminists have consistently offered critical insights into how to make the rallying cry of Black Lives Matter more inclusive of Black trans and cis girls and women, as well as for gender-expansive Black people and families. As a multi-city and global coalition erupts and demands the liberation of Black lives, the time is ripe for a queer coalition for reproductive justice. © 2020 by the American Anthropological Association.},

Specifically, it explores two types of succession: (1) from grassroots or community-embedded leadership to bridge leadership (which connects the community to the organization), and (2) from bridge to formal leadership. Our study shows how these two types of succession were instrumental in operationalizing margins-to-center organizing. We present our findings in a series of conjunctures or episodes to elucidate how Black women and women of color moved gradually through different forms of leadership.

We conducted a thematic analysis of the narratives of 17 participants who had been labeled “overweight” or “obese” while pregnant and/or seeking reproductive health care related to fertility and/or pregnancy. Participants’ narratives speak to experiences of being surveilled and controlled in medical settings; this surveillance and control negatively impacted their access to desired care. In order to receive the kinds of care they wanted, many participants had to become self-advocates. This self-advocacy speaks to resistance and “resilience”; we discuss how individualizing “resilience” represents an incomplete solution to navigating the shaming and blaming encounters participants experienced with healthcare providers. We argue for health care that is more caring and responsive to the needs of diverse individuals who are or who are seeking to become pregnant. © 2020 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues},

RJ's tenets are that women have the human rights to decide if or when they'll become pregnant, whether to carry a pregnancy to term, and to parent the children they have in safe and healthy environments. Recognizing the importance of the rights at stake when the law addresses parenting and procreation, the authors in this book re-imagine judicial opinions that address the law's treatment of pregnancy and parenting. The cases cover topics such as forced sterilization, pregnancy discrimination, criminal penalties for women who take illegal drugs while pregnant, and state funding for abortion. Though some of the re-imagined cases come to the same conclusions as the originals, each rewritten opinion analyzes how these cases impact the most vulnerable populations, including people with disabilities, poor women, and women of color. © Kimberly M.

To date, there is limited research on the dialectical relationship between inequality, economic growth, and the environment. The present study seeks to further understand the relationship between social inequality and the environment by assessing how gender equality decouples economic growth from CO2 emissions. We construct a fixed-effects panel regression model with robust standard errors that accounts for clustering in 140 nations to assess how gender inequality interacts with GDP per capita to influence CO2 emissions per capita. Our findings indicate that in nations with more gender equality, the association between GDP per capita and CO2 emissions is much lower than in nations with higher levels of gender inequality. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Discussions of stigma (Goffman 1963) have often focused on elements of one's character, something which makes people nervous, uncomfortable, and afraid. In discussions regarding reproductive rights and reproductive justice, however, stigma can be discussed in relation not only to elements of an individuals' character, or a stigmatised behaviour, but also the taboo that surrounds specific decisions and decision-making processes. This research, framed around concepts of reproductive rights in the context of Northern Ireland, looks at spaces of discomfort in relation to the sexed and sexualised body, one that challenges traditional morals and values associated with the church. Situated in a broader context of challenges and restrictions on reproductive rights, I investigate the way in which discussions of abortion, women's sexual liberation, and the right to make choices regarding one's own body are framed in the context of a discomforting narrative, the use of which itself manages social normativities regarding reproductive choices. Utilising empirical data gathered through semi-structured interviews, ethnographic and archival material, this paper looks at the involvement of dominant narratives of women's bodies to understand how a discomforting narrative of women, of sex, and of reproduction is created in the case of Northern Ireland. © 2020},

It then surveys three promising directions for feminist abortion scholarship. The first is work inspired by the Reproductive Justice Movement, that points to the intersectional axes of inequality that shape abortion discourse and position us in relation to reproductive choice and access issues. The second is work that examines the particularity of the constitution of the aborting body, reflecting the particularity of the pregnant body. This is a specific body, with a specific history; abortion discourse draws from and makes a significant contribution to the meaning and lived experience of this body. The third area of scholarship we highlight is that which seeks to amplify the meaning of abortion as a social good. Much abortion scholarship is attuned to a critique of negative aspects of abortion—from its representation in popular culture to restrictive law and access issues. This is critical work but/and the performative nature of abortion scholarship, like all discourse, means that it can amplify the association of negativity with abortion.

	abstract = {This article explores how the recognition of the gender identity of trans people can have negative consequences on their reproductive health and rights. First, it argues that, while both the right to gender identity and the right to sexual and reproductive health are part of the indivisible core of human rights, in practice trans people are forced to choose between them. Understanding this scenario requires focusing on the eugenic dimensions of trans policies, even in states where the recognition of a gender identity other than that assigned at birth is not tied to surgical or hormonal compromises. The concept of “passive eugenics”, coined over twenty years ago by James Bowman, offers a valuable key in this respect. Second, the paper highlights some factors that hinder a successful approach to the reproductive health and rights of trans people. These factors include: the normative imageries about the reproductive capacities and desires of trans people, representations about pregnancy and “womanhood”, and the form taken by identity politics in contemporary feminist movements. The attention given as a priority (if not exclusively) to initiatives for the legalisation of voluntary abortion, understood as a right pertaining to (cis) women, offers a significant example of these difficulties. Finally, the paper advocates the adoption of a reproductive justice approach to work on sexual and reproductive health and rights, arguing that it has, among other virtues, that of challenging the binary matrix that characterises Western thought. © 2020 The Author(s).

	abstract = {As the technology for ectogenesis continues to advance, the ethical implications of such developments should be thoroughly and proactively explored. The possibility of full ectogenesis remains hypothetical at present, and myriad concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of the technology must be evaluated and addressed, while pressing moral considerations should be fully deliberated. However, it is conceivable that the technology may become sufficiently well established in the future and that eventually full ectogenesis might be deemed ethically acceptable as a reproductive alternative to gestation within a human womb under certain circumstances. If the safety and efficacy of full ectogenesis are established, if ethical dilemmas are sufficiently well addressed, and if the technology is offered as a reproductive option to cisgender heterosexual individuals or couples desiring to become parents, there is a moral obligation grounded in social justice to ensure that full ectogenesis be made available to individuals or couples identifying as members of sexual- or gender-minority groups who likewise seek to pursue parenthood. We examine the history of access to current family-building options, including assisted reproductive technology, surrogacy and adoption, for these populations and conclude that in the absence of robust empirical evidence suggesting an increased risk of harm to children of individuals and couples who identify as members of sexual- or gender-minority groups, equitable access to ectogenesis as a pathway to parenthood for sexual and gender minorities must be assured as a matter of reproductive justice. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

Our study investigated the narratives related to sexual transmission of Zika virus that circulated on Twitter during a public health emergency and analyzed the relationship between information on Twitter and on traditional media. We examined 10,748 tweets posted during the peaks of Twitter activity between January and March 2016. Posts in English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese and websites linked to tweets were manually reviewed and analyzed thematically. During the study period, there were three peaks of Twitter activity related to the sexual transmission of Zika. Most tweets in the first peak (n = 412) had humorous/sarcastic content (55%). Most tweets in the second and third peaks (n = 5,154 and n = 5,182, respectively) disseminated information (>93%). Across languages, textual and visual content on the websites were predominantly placed online by traditional media and highlighted epidemiological narratives published by public health agencies, with little or no mention of the concerns or experiences of individuals most affected by Zika. Prioritising epidemiological/clinical aspects of epidemics may have a depoliticising effect and contribute to overlooking socio-economic determinants of the Zika epidemic and issues related to reproductive justice. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Skinner is the first Supreme Court decision to subject a law limiting reproduction to stringent scrutiny, and it achieves this result by entwining constitutional protection of reproductive liberty with equality. Unlike the reproductive rights framework, which focuses upon the individual's right to make reproductive choices free from government regulation, reproductive justice emphasizes the political context within which race, gender, class, and other identities intersect to result in reproductive oppression. Skinner foreshadows this broader analysis, by striking down a state sterilization statute not because it interfered with individual liberty but based upon the recognition that governmental power to draw lines regarding who could reproduce and who could not posed the threat of "invidious discriminations against groups or types of individuals" in violation of the constitutional guarantee of equality. © Kimberly M.

Design/methodology/approach: To generate a mother’s narrative, the author asked the following research question: What do you think Black girls need in an afterschool club or in education, or in general? Findings: The author found that the mother’s narrative could be productively contextualized within a reproductive justice framework which gave insights into the mother’s experiences of multiple and simultaneous oppressions which aligned with her social identities with regard to race, class, gender and sexuality. These experiences in turn informed her critical literacies of Black motherhood and girlhood. The author found the system of white heteropatriarchal capitalism, through the privatization of public goods and the lack of adequate social services penalizes Black working mothers and obstructs their ability to mother their children adequately. Research limitations/implications: Critical literacies of Black motherhood and girlhood should be harnessed for holistic approaches to the literacy education of Black girls, with a focus on improving their life outcomes, enhancing potential for them to realize their gifts, and ending the many forms of violence against them. Originality/value: Centering the voices of Black mothers as critical literacy education has the potential to thwart oppressive reproductive politics and practices and promote social justice. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Many researchers and policymakers have linked contraceptive programs to improvements in women's and children's socioeconomic outcomes. However, these studies have overlooked how socioeconomic status may be an initial driver of contraceptive choice and behavior. Here, I examine the relationship between a comprehensive measure of socioeconomic disadvantage, self-identified race, and contraceptive method selection at enrollment in a unique longitudinal study of contraceptive clients who received a new type of method at no cost. I then examine whether socioeconomic disadvantage has an association with contraceptive switching or discontinuation. I demonstrate that socioeconomic disadvantage decreases the chance of selecting any IUD, while Black racial membership increases the chance of selecting the 3-month injectable and Multiracial membership increases the chance of selecting the Vaginal Ring. I then demonstrate that socioeconomic disadvantage and self-identified race have intersectional and variable associations with switching, and, to a lesser extent, discontinuing methods. These findings offer an important insight for implementation in contraceptive programs: eliminating financial barriers to access contraceptive services does not eliminate the socioeconomic contexts that influence method selection and use that occur as part of everyday lived experiences. Taken cumulatively, these results suggest that contraceptive services should be offered to women in ways that ensure access to reproductive justice without obscuring the need for social changes in the institutions that create disadvantage and shape contraceptive use itself. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

We consider the ways in which reproductive risk is typically storied in healthcare and culture, and analyse multimedia/digital stories made by participant-video-makers which story reproductive wellbeing differently. We examine three major themes—on risk, on recognition of weight and other stigma, and on reclamation of bodies—that emerged as critical to these storytellers as they navigated fatphobia in reproductive care. We argue that just as healthcare practitioners strive to practice evidence-based care we must also put into practice storied care—to believe, respect and honour fat people’s stories of their bodies and lives as fundamental to achieving equity and justice in reproductive healthcare. © 2020 by Author/s.},

	abstract = {This chapter is about the far-reaching struggle for reproductive justice through the lens of Black women in the US and immigrant women in Chile, linking local to global understanding of reproductive oppression. Reproductive justice (RJ) is defined as a theoretical paradigm that centers the experiences of marginalized Black women and other Women of Color (WOC) around issues related to their bodies, sexuality, and reproduction as a human right. It theorizes on three primary interconnected reproductive human rights: (i) the right to have a child under the conditions of one's choosing; (ii) the right not to have a child using birth control, abortion, or abstinence; and (iii) the right to parent children in safe and healthy environments free from violence by individuals or the state. No country in the world has committed to a vision that can guarantee the physical security of women. Living free from violence is a human right. A reproductive justice frame aids in understanding the complex system of interlocking forms of oppression in which women's reproductive relations are embedded. Having an understanding of the multiple systems of inequity (social construction of laws, policies, cultural attitudes, poverty, discriminatory practices, violent harms against women) that impact women helps to be able to deconstruct inequity in order to change it for women globally. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

	abstract = {Background Since 2009, the International Conference on Family Planning (ICFP) has served as an opportunity for the global reproductive health community to share FP advances and practice lessons in the areas of research, programming, and advocacy. The purpose of this paper was to synthesize the key results and findings presented by members of the FP community at the 2018 ICFP Conference. Methods More than 700 abstracts from all 15 conference tracks were reviewed and 64 abstracts total were selected for this paper based on the novelty and urgency of the findings. The content analysis of conference abstracts were grouped into six final thematic areas. Results 1) Investing in family planning for a lifetime of returns. FP continues to face a shortage of funding. Domestically based and locally owned funding models provide alternative financing solutions. 2) Addressing inequities in family planning for key populations. Various populations still face challenges in accessing FP. Youth-inclusive and user-centered programming show promise in addressing such challenges. 3) Reproductive justice, Unsafe abortions tend to be more common among younger, poor, uneducated and rural women. Legislation is still needed to facilitate a culture of safe abortions. 4) Couple dynamics and decision-making. Couples who share equitable responsibility in decision-making processes are more likely to use contraceptives; couple disagreement influences women’s decisions to covertly use FP. 5) Male involvement in programming. Male champions can successfully promote uptake of FP. Gender-transformative programming promotes gender equity and impacts behavior change. 6) Breakthroughs in novel contraceptives and systems improvement in family planning. Recent advances include user-centered contraceptive technologies that allow for self-administration and information systems which optimize supply chain management. Conclusion The research, advocacy, and programmatic abstracts at ICFP 2018 highlighted research advances, showcased implementation science wins, and provided evidence of critical knowledge gaps in global FP access and use © 2021.

These shifts include approaches to sexuality and reproduction: a population control emphasis in the late 1940s, a reproductive rights paradigm in the 1990s, and progression from reproductive rights to reproductive justice. Feminist psychologists have to traverse the political landscape created by these broad approaches. In this chapter, we suggest ways in which such engagement may be facilitated through examination of mainstream assumptions and outcomes and the use of nuanced feminist research. Drawing from transnational feminisms, the principles of reproductive justice, and examples of research and interventions in reproductive decision-making, abortion, obstetric violence, "deviant" (m)others, early reproduction, and contraception, we argue that feminist psychology should attend to both global and cross-cutting power relations concerning fertility and reproduction, as well as localized dynamics. © Cambridge University Press 2020.

	abstract = {Long acting reversible contraceptives (LARC), including intrauterine devices (IUDs) and contraceptive implants, can support an individual in meeting their reproductive goals by allowing them to prevent pregnancy effectively. These devices can also limit an individual’s control over reproduction because they generally require an in-person visit to a health care provider for removal. Returning for another visit may be logistically challenging for many individuals who may need to arrange for transportation, childcare, or take time off from work. Effectively negotiating with a provider to request removal may be additionally challenging for medically underserved and disenfranchised people who may not feel empowered to do so. The objective of this study was to assess providers’ willingness to honor patients’ requests for IUD and contraceptive implant removal on the day of the request. A survey was conducted in which clinicians were presented with scenarios of women requesting IUD or implant removal. Clinicians were asked what they were most likely to do. A total of 105 clinicians were surveyed. The responses of 60 clinicians who inserted IUDs and 57 who provided the contraceptive implant were included in the analysis. When asked about same-day removal of an IUD or implant from a dissatisfied patient who requested removal, 40% stated they would remove the implant, and 57% stated they would remove the IUD on the day of the request.

	abstract = {Public health officials and major health care organizations in the United States have identified long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) as the first-line option for preventing unintended pregnancy. Existing research on LARC focuses on efficacy and usage rates, generally effacing women's lived experiences with these historically controversial devices. We take a critical, reproductive justice-informed approach to LARC promotion efforts in this qualitative, focus group study. Across six groups of undergraduate women ages 18–24 (N = 30, majority White), we explore how the individuals targeted by contemporary LARC promotion efforts—emerging adult women who have never given birth—negotiate (not) acquiring these devices. We introduce reproductive anxiety and conditional agency as key terms through which our participants made meaning out of LARC. Though participants reflected socially normative discourses of empowerment and choice, our findings suggest that these relatively privileged respondents experienced their choices to use or not use LARC in neoliberal terms. Specifically, we suggest their responses avert attention from the multifarious ways that women's reproductive capacities are differentially disciplined by hegemonic norms. We conclude by suggesting that sexual and reproductive health policy must foreground issues of structural intersectionality—rather than cost or efficacy—so that health promotion efforts do not inadvertently exacerbate inequalities. © 2019 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues},

Several major health organizations now recommend tiered-effectiveness counseling, in which the most effective methods are explained first so that patients can use information about the relative efficacy of contraceptive methods to make an informed choice. Some scholars and practitioners have raised concerns that, given histories of inequitable treatment and coercion in reproductive health care, tiered-effectiveness counseling may undermine patient autonomy and choice. This Clinical Opinion examines the development of tiered-effectiveness contraceptive counseling, how its rise mirrored the focus on promoting LARC to decrease the unintended pregnancy rate, and key considerations and the potential conflicts of a LARC-first model with patient-centered care. Finally, we discuss how reproductive justice and shared decision making can guide efforts to provide patient-centered contraceptive care. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

The review is based on the analysis of 39 articles, which belong to a range of different disciplines (mostly sociology, social psychology, anthropology, ethnology, and gender studies). The number of interviews in each study range from as few as seven to over one hundred. Countries covered include Australia, Canada, Greece, India, Iran, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Norway, Russia, Sweden, UK, Ukraine, and the USA. Most studies focus only on surrogacy practices in one country (although often with intended parents from other countries), and some include several countries (e.g. interviewees from several countries or fieldwork in different field-sites). The proposed typology goes beyond the division between altruistic versus commercial, and traditional versus gestational surrogacy, in order to inform further research and to contribute to bioethical and policy debates on surrogacy in a transnational context. Four types of relations are identifiable: open, restricted, structured, and enmeshed. The criteria which influence these relationships are: the frequency and character of contact pre- and post-birth; expectations of both parties; the type of exchange involved in surrogacy arrangements; and cultural, legal, and economic contexts. The theoretical contribution of the article is to further the development of a relational justice approach to surrogacy. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Condoms have high failure rates and surgical vasectomy is not reliably reversible. There is a global need and desire for novel male contraceptive methods. Hormonal methods have progressed the furthest in clinical development and androgen plus progestin formulations hold promise as a marketable, reversible male contraceptive over the next decade. Investigators have tested androgen plus progestin approaches using oral, transdermal, subdermal, and injectable drug formulations and demonstrated the short-term safety and reversibility of hormonal male contraception. The most commonly reported side effects associated with hormonal male contraception include weight gain, acne, slight suppression of serum high-density cholesterol, mood changes, and changes in libido. Efficacy trials of hormonal male contraceptives have demonstrated contraceptive efficacy rates greater than that of condoms. Although there has been less progression in the development of nonhormonal male contraceptives, potentially reversible vaso-occlusive methods are currently in clinical trials in some countries. Various studies have confirmed both men and women’s desire for novel male contraceptives. Barriers to development include an absence of investment from pharmaceutical companies, concerns regarding side effects and spermatogenic rebound with hormonal methods, and lack of clear reversibility and proven effectiveness of nonhormonal methods. The ultimate availability of male contraceptives could have an important impact on decreasing global unintended pregnancy rates (currently 40% of all pregnancies) and will be a step towards reproductive justice and greater equity in family planning. © 2020, Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine Inc.

Through an analysis of blog posts and comment threads written in response to the conference proceedings, I find that participants in the feminist counterpublic of birth advocacy utilize three primary strategies: they redefine VBAC as “just birth” rather than a medical “procedure;” they recontextualize the biomedical use of “risk” to include other factors outside of the immediate context of the hospital; and they reframe VBAC as a right rather than a preference. Together, these strategies work together to demonstrate the incommensurability of “shared doctor–patient decision making” within the current biomedical model of care. This move, toward a rights-based framework within a more highly contextualized systemic critique of health care, positions VBAC to be an issue that could link birth advocacy to a larger feminist health justice movement. © 2020, © 2020 The Organization for Research on Women and Communication.},

While significant differences exist some generalizations are possible. First, women had a monopoly on reproductive services prior to the eighteenth century. Second, before the mid-nineteenth century, women were their own authorities on whether a pregnancy had reached viable status. Third, in capitalist countries, in order to overturn criminalization of contraception and abortion, feminists often had to accept compromises with the medical establishment. Fourth, the history of the womb is tied inextricably to the history of eugenics. Lastly, socialists proved more radical advocates for reproductive rights than other progressives; communist countries, with few exceptions, legalized abortion earlier than capitalist countries. However, it is in liberal democracies that women from marginalized communities have been able to raise awareness about forced contraception and redefine "reproductive justice" to include the right to raise children in healthy environments. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

Joining an increasing body of critical scholarship that calls for nuance in understanding reproduction amongst young people, we draw, in this paper, on data generated from an ethnographic study conducted in antenatal care units in an Eastern Cape township in South Africa. To illustrate the approach we propose, we home in on five case studies that highlight the variability of young women’s lives, the multiple injustices they experience, and the agency they demonstrate in negotiating their way through pregnancy and birth. Injustices evident in these cases centre on sexual violence, rape myths, education system failures, health system failures, shaming and stigmatising practices, socio-economic precariousness, absent male partners, and denial of services. We outline how the reparative justice approach that highlights repair and support for social and health injustices at the individual and collective level as well as at the material and symbolic level may be taken up to ensure reproductive justice for young pregnant women. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Study Design: We recruited obstetrician–gynecologists practicing in ten geographically diverse US states for a qualitative study using the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists directory. We conducted semi-structured interviews via telephone, professionally transcribed, and analyzed using the constant comparative method and principles of grounded theory. Results: We interviewed thirty obstetrician–gynecologists (63.3% women, 76.7% non-subspecialized, and 53.3% academic setting). Participants largely described the consent form as unnecessary, paternalistic, an administrative hassle, a barrier to desired patient care, and associated with worse health outcomes. Views on the waiting period's utility and impact were mixed. Many participants felt the sterilization policy was discriminatory. However, some participants noted the policy's importance in terms of the historical basis, used the form as a counseling tool to remind patients of the permanence of sterilization, felt the policy prompted them to counsel regarding sterilization, and protected patients in contemporary medical practice. Conclusion: Many physicians shared concerns about the ethics and clinical impact of the Medicaid sterilization policy. Future revisions to the Medicaid sterilization policy must balance prevention of coercion with reduction in barriers to those desiring sterilization in order to maximize reproductive autonomy. Implications: Obstetrician–gynecologists are key stakeholders of the Medicaid sterilization policy. Obstetrician–gynecologists largely believe that revision to the Medicaid sterilization policy is warranted to balance reduction of external barriers to desired care with a process that enforces the need for counseling regarding contraception and reviewing patient preference for sterilization throughout pregnancy in order to minimize regret. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

Despite transdisciplinary literature citing structural racism as a root cause of inequity, interventions continue to be mostly physician-centered models of perinatal and reproductive healthcare (PRH). These models prioritize individual, biomedical risk identification and stratification as solutions to achieving equity, without adequately addressing the social and structural determinants of health. The objective of this review is to: (1) examine the association between the impact of structural and obstetric racism and patient-centered access to PRH, (2) define and apply reproductive justice (RJ) as a framework to combat structural and obstetric racism in PRH, and (3) describe and demonstrate how to use an RJ lens to critically analyze physician-led and community-informed PRH models. We conclude with recommendations for building a PRH workforce whose capacity is aligned with racial equity. Institutional alignment with a RJ praxis creates opportunities for advancing PRH workforce diversification and development and improving PRH experiences and outcomes for our patients, communities, and workforce. © 2020},

This chapter uses the Reproductive Justice framework developed by SisterSong to analyze gendered forms of labor control experienced by migrant and immigrant workers in US agriculture. Our review of the literature covers farmworkers’ experiences of sexual violence, constraints on their expression of sexuality, the inadequacy of wages for raising families, pesticide exposure (particularly among pregnant women and children), unsafe and indecent housing conditions, and the extended family separations that intrinsic to guestworker visa programs. We find that an intersectional analysis is necessary to understand these forms of reproductive injustice, which are exacerbated by inequities of gender, race, ethnicity, class, immigration status, and age. However, women farmworkers should not be construed as passive victims. Rather, we conclude by demonstrating their efforts to transform the structures that oppress them through resistances at the level of the farm, community, and the nation. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Kathleen Sexsmith and Megan A.

To understand the meanings and negotiations of difference in collective action, this article examines how Latinx feminists do intersectionality in the movement for reproductive justice (RJ). Drawing on three years of ethnographic observations and in-depth interviews with a Latina/x reproductive justice organization in California, I argue that staff of the organization engage in contextual, relational, and cultural shift practices that together create a fluid sensibility, what I term “politicmaking,” focused on negotiating difference as a necessarily fraught and messy endeavor.

Although unconsented to medical treatment presents a traditional tort claim for battery, the trial judge dismissed this claim because he considered the sterilization neither physically harmful nor offensive. The rewritten feminist opinion draws on the history of involuntary sterilization of women of color to conclude that such conduct is inherently outrageous and causes serious physical and emotional harm, and thus should be redressed as both a battery and as intentional infliction of emotional distress, with punitive damages. The feminist opinion highlights the ways the actual judgment distorts both the law and the reality of women’s experience of harm. The accompanying commentary situates this case in the history of racially based involuntary sterilization and both medical and judicial dismissiveness of the seriousness of the harm, and thus sheds light on how tort law has failed to deter this abusive practice. © Cambridge University Press 2020.},

The data for this study includes 1 year of digital ethnographic work as a hotline volunteer at the abortion fund, along with in-depth interviews with the fund's advocacy team. The fund organizers want to appeal to supporters, protect and empower communities, confront systemic oppression, and dispel medically incorrect, neoliberal (i.e., racist, sexist, and classist) anti-abortion myths. Due to societal stigma and silence, public abortion discourse is largely shaped by media (mis)representation. To combat misinformation and misogyny, reproductive justice (RJ) organizers disrupt mainstream abortion narratives with their own outreach. The organizers in this study use social media to interact with the public, supporters, donors, and anti-abortion activists alike. While these organizers publish anonymous data and stories from their hotline on social media, they also vigorously protect the privacy of their callers and hotline volunteers. The organizers recognize the importance of callers seeing their experiences represented in public discourse while also feeling protected from anti-abortion backlash. Therefore, I argue the abortion fund organizers carrying out this digital advocacy work are engaging in multifaceted emotional labor and putting their bodies on the line for a stigmatized issue. This study is informed by research that speaks to the promises and perils of new media for community building, movement organizing, and what Molina-Guzmán (2010) calls "symbolic rupture."Social movement organizers work within the shifting media environment to transform cultural narratives, build solidarity, sustain their organizations, fundraise, and stand on the front line of stigmatized issues - even while enduring the consequences of personal exposure.  © Gantt-Shafer.},

This study shows how poverty interacts with gender power relations to impact upon adolescent girls’ sexual and reproductive lives in Western Uganda. Qualitative research with 147 participants was undertaken. This comprised 59 in-depth interviews and 11 focus group discussions with groups of 12–14 year-old young women, teachers and parents. Data were analysed manually using open and axial coding, and conclusions were generated inductively. Findings reveal that young women are restricted in exercising their sexual and reproductive rights not only by poverty and unequal gender relations, but also by corruption and poor service provision. In contrast to interventions using liberal rights-based approaches, we advocate the use of a ‘marketplace of options’ since access to sexual and reproductive health services is very limited for poor girls and not evenly distributed. Moreover, while poverty and unequal gender relations render girls vulnerable to sexual coercion and violence, the criminal justice system is often weak, leaving victims powerless. Investment in appropriate resources and inclusive and affordable access to justice is essential to advance young women’s sexual and reproductive health. © 2019 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Sex-Positive Criminology proposes a new way to think about sexuality in the fields of criminology and criminal justice. Sex-positivity is framed as a humanizing approach to sexuality that supports the well-being of self and others. It is rooted in the principle of active and ongoing consent, and it encourages perspectives that value bodily autonomy, the right to access education, and respect for sexual difference. In this book, the authors argue that institutions such as prisons, schools, and healthcare facilities, as well as agents of governments, such as law enforcement, correctional officers, and politicians, can unduly cause harm and perpetuate stigma through the regulation and criminalization of sexuality. In order to critique institutions that criminalize and regulate sexuality, the authors of Sex-Positive Criminology examine case studies exploring the criminalization of commercial sex and related harm (at the hands of law enforcement) experienced by those who sell sex. They investigate sex education in schools, reproductive justice in communities and institutions, and restrictions on sexuality in places like prisons, jails, juvenile detention, and immigrant detention facilities. They look into the criminalization of BDSM practices and address concerns about young people's sexuality connected to age of consent and privacy violations. The authors demonstrate how a sex-positive perspective could help criminologists, policymakers, and educators understand not only how to move away from sex-negative frameworks in theory, policy, and practice, but how sex-positive criminological frameworks can be a useful tool to reduce harm and increase personal agency. Written in a clear and direct style, this book will appeal to students and scholars in criminology, sociology, sexuality studies, cultural studies, criminal justice, social theory, and all those interested in the relationship between sexuality and the crimino-legal system. © 2021 Aimee Wodda and Vanessa R.

	abstract = {Prior research has shown that immigration law enforcement contributes to poor health outcomes—including reproductive health outcomes—among Latinos. Yet no prior research has examined how immigration enforcement might inhibit reproductive justice and limit individual’s reproductive autonomy. We utilized data from an existing study that consisted of a partnership with a Latino community in Michigan in which an immigration raid resulted in multiple arrests and deportations midway through data collection. Using cross-sectional survey data (n = 192) where no one was re-interviewed, we used ordinal logistic regression to compare desired pregnancy timing of individuals surveyed prior to and after the raid to determine the impact of an immigration raid on desired timing of next pregnancy. We then used qualitative data—including 21 in-depth interviews and participant observation—collected in the community after the raid to contextualize our findings. Controlling for socio-demographic characteristics, we found that Latinos surveyed in the aftermath of the raid were more likely to report a greater desire to delay childbearing than Latinos surveyed before the raid occurred. Our qualitative data showed that an immigration raid has financial and psychological effects on immigrant families and that a raid may impact reproductive autonomy because people are fearful of these impacts. These finding suggest that current immigration enforcement efforts may influence reproductive decision-making, impede Latinos reproductive autonomy, and that family-friendly immigration policy reform is needed. © 2019 Fleming et al.

	abstract = {Phenomenon: Reproductive justice (RJ) is defined by women of color advocates as the right to have children, not have children and parent children while maintaining reproductive autonomy. In the United States, physicians have been complicit in multiple historical reproductive injustices, involving coercive sterilization of thousands of people of color, low income, and disabilities. Currently, reproductive injustices continue to occur; however, physicians have no formal RJ medical education to address injustices. The objective of this study was to engage leading advocates within the movement using a Delphi method to identify critical components for such a curriculum. Approach: In 2016, we invited 65 RJ advocates and leaders to participate in an expert panel to design RJ medical education. A 3-round Delphi survey was distributed electronically to identify content for inclusion in an RJ curriculum. In the next 2 survey rounds, experts offered feedback and revisions and rated agreement with including content recommendations in the final curriculum. We calculated descriptive statistics to analyze quantitative data. A team with educational expertise wrote learning outcomes based on expert content recommendations. Findings: Of the 65 RJ advocates and leaders invited, 41 participated on the expert panel of the Delphi survey. In the first survey, the expert panel recommended 58 RJ content areas through open-ended response. Over the next 2 rounds, there was consensus among the panel to include 52 of 58 of these areas in the curriculum. Recommended content fell into 11 broad domains: access, disparities, and structural competency; advocacy; approaches to reproductive healthcare; contemporary law and policy; cultural safety; historical injustices; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, and intersex health; oppression, power, and bias training; patient care; reproductive health; and RJ definitions. The 97 learning outcomes created from this process represented both unique and existing educational elements. Insights: A collaborative methodology infused with RJ values can bridge experts in advocacy and academics. New learning outcomes identified through this process can enhance medical education; however, it is just as important to consider education in RJ approaches to care as it is knowledge about that care. We must explore the pedagogic process of RJ medical education while considering that expertise in this area may exist outside of the medical community and thus there is a need to partner with RJ advocates. Finally, we expect to use innovative teaching methods to transform medical education and achieve an RJ focus. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

We also consider literature that explores health professionals’ experiences and perceptions related to fatness and the care for women’s reproductive health.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has recommended long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) as first-line pregnancy prevention for all women and adolescent girls. However, continued reproductive coercion in the U.S., especially among underserved populations, problematizes the promotion of LARC methods. We conducted six focus groups (n = 61) and 18 interviews with women ages 18–44 years to explore the impact of coercion on women’s perspectives of LARC methods and messages about LARC. Findings suggest the importance of identity in how women make meaning of LARC methods. Identification with women who use LARC methods influenced participants’ understanding of contraceptive choice. Lack of information provided by health care providers about LARC served as a barrier to method knowledge. Findings from this study offer theoretical and practical opportunities to guide health care practitioners and health communication campaigns aimed at decreasing the burden of unintended pregnancy while maintaining reproductive justice. © 2019, © 2019 Society for Menstrual Cycle Research.},

The second is the biomedical delineation of the environment of reproduction and development as an object of growing research and intervention, as well as the marking off of early-life environments as an "exposed biology" consequential to the entire life span. Third is researchers critical engagement with the reproductive subject of environmental politics and the lived experience of reproduction in environmentally dystopic times.

	abstract = {Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are safe and highly effective methods of long-acting reversible contraception. While increased use of these methods has been associated with decreased rates of unintended pregnancy and abortion in adolescents and young adults, these methods require provider visits for method initiation (and often for discontinuation) that can be significant rate-limiting steps for method use. When adolescents and young adults choose an IUD for their contraceptive method, it is crucial that providers work to remove barriers to both initiation and discontinuation of these methods. For IUD insertions, proposing clinic and medical system policies that support same-day insertion of IUDs, immediate postpartum insertion, and immediate postabortion insertion can help reduce these barriers. Importantly, at time of insertion, and throughout use, it is essential to ensure that patients can choose to discontinue the method at any time—without question—in order to fully support their bodily and reproductive autonomy. This chapter will discuss the timing of IUD insertion, including insertion at any time during the menstrual cycle as long as pregnancy can be reasonably excluded—and insertion following vaginal delivery, cesarean section, and abortion. We will also review use of the copper IUD as a highly effective form of emergency contraception. Lastly, this chapter will address the importance of framing these conversations using reproductive justice principles of non-coercive counseling methods, and creating clinical spaces for shared decision-making with IUDs in order to ensure contraception free of reproductive coercion. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

	abstract = {Unassisted childbirth, also known as “freebirth,” is when a person intentionally gives birth at home with no professional birth attendant. The limited research on unassisted birth in the United States focuses on women's reasons for making this choice. Studies suggest women are committed to birthing without a professional and that this choice is rooted in religious or natural-family belief systems. These studies do not adequately account for the ways a framework of “choice” obscures the role structural barriers play in decision-making processes. International research on unassisted childbirth finds that it is not always a first choice and may be a last resort for women who have had negative experiences with maternity care. More research on unassisted birth in the United States is needed to better understand if people face similar structural barriers. In this paper I examine how structural limitations of the US healthcare system intersect with values in decision-making processes about childbirth. Drawing on in-depth interviews with nine women who gave birth unassisted in the United States, I examine the women's shared ideological commitments, negative experiences with health care, and barriers faced seeking care. I discovered that unassisted birth may not be a first, or even positive choice, but rather a compromise informed by ideological commitments and constrained choices. Structural barriers in the US healthcare system prevented women from having a professional birth attendant who they felt was acceptable, available, and accessible. I conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for debates about birth justice and health policy. © 2020 by Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In Lebanon, the state's political agenda influences laws and policies that restrict or encourage women's procreation, depending on their nationality, sect, marital, and legal status. Since 1943, Lebanon's system of proportionally allocating parliamentary seats to sectarian political parties, based on their population size, has spurred fears of demographic changes across sects. This fear is also referenced by politicians as the reason why Lebanese women are legally denied their rights of passing citizenship on to their children and non-Lebanese spouses. With Lebanon holding the highest refugee population per capita in the world, the fear of disturbing the "sectarian balance" directly collides with the reproductive autonomy of both Syrian and Palestinian refugee women. Migrant women living in Lebanon are also restricted to playing out their role as workers and therefore have their sexual and reproductive health and rights denied. Another fear of the state is that of changing moral values, whereby motherhood and parenthood in single women, queer, transgender, and intersex persons are perceived as deviant and a threat to traditional values. This review aims to display how, through fear - of changing moral values and demographic shifts - the Lebanese state practices reproductive oppression on part of the population, while neglecting them and exacerbating their difficult living conditions.},

	abstract = {There has been increasing interest in collaborative approaches between the environmental justice (EJ) and reproductive justice (RJ) movements to address the higher burden of toxic exposures and associated reproductive health outcomes in vulnerable communities. This study examined the collective action frames (CAFs) of advocates at the EJ/RJ nexus. CAFs highlight how advocates identify problems and solutions, and motivate action. The use of intersectionality was identified as a main CAF used in three key ways: breaking free from identity-based, issue-based, and movement-based siloes. First, interviewees described breaking free from identity-based siloes by identifying risks of toxic exposures that result from intersecting social locations (e.g. gender, race/ethnicity, income, immigration status) and by equally prioritizing multiple aspects of their identities as they engage in advocacy. Second, they described breaking free from issue-based siloes by developing multi-issue agendas that address a complex web of interrelated problems impacting health. Third, they described breaking free from movement-based siloes by developing cross-movement collaborations to address issues of mutual concern. Among multiple reasons given for cross-movement collaborations, advocates perceived them as valuable in order to disrupt social, political, and economic power imbalances that shape environmental reproductive health inequities, as well as other health and social inequities. Based on these findings, we suggest that intersectionality is a master frame, and thus may be useful to advocates in other social movements addressing intersectional issues. Understanding an intersectionality frame can help to inform advocacy approaches to promote health and health equity, particularly those focused on policies and structural drivers of health. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

We make a case for the increased visibility of reproductive justice within education and professional activity, employing case studies from Australia, the Republic of Ireland and New Zealand to illustrate recent social work advocacy on abortion rights.

Framed around a pair of interwoven reproductive stories, and located within a reproductive justice framework, it asserts that women’s stories of fertility, pregnancy, contraception, and abortion have, both historically and in the contemporary period, been marked by silences. Such silences, the result of political, legal, social, and moral forces beyond women’s control, have limited women’s abilities to share and reflect on the intricate negotiations that have shaped their reproductive lives, and as a consequence, have also limited their capacities for telling their reproductive stories. As this article argues, all reproductive stories are complex stories. Too often, however, those complex nuances that shape women’s reproductive lives and stories remain hidden, unspoken, and secret. Making room for the intricacies of reproductive stories and storytelling can also, this article argues, offer greater nuance to continuing debates around reproductive rights and reproductive justice. © 2017, © 2017 SAGE Publications.},

	abstract = {The Catholic Hierarchy unequivocally bans abortion, defining it as a mortal sin. In Mexico City, where the Catholic Church wields considerable political and popular power, abortion was recently decriminalized in a historic vote. Of the roughly 170,000 abortions that have been carried out in Mexico City's new public sector abortion program to date, more than 60% were among self-reported Catholic women. Drawing on eighteen months of fieldwork, including interviews with 34 Catholic patients, this article examines how Catholic women in Mexico City grapple with abortion decisions that contravene Church teachings in the context of recent abortion reform. Catholic women consistently leveraged the local cultural, economic, and legal context to morally justify their abortion decisions against church condemnation. I argue that Catholic women seeking abortion resist religious injunctions on their reproductive behavior by articulating and asserting their own moral agency grounded in the contextual dimensions of their lives. My analysis informs conversations in medical anthropology on moral decision-making around reproduction and on local dynamics of resistance to reproductive governance. Moreover, my findings speak to the deficiencies of a feminist vision focused narrowly on fertility limitation, versus an expanded framework of reproductive justice that considers as well the need for conditions of income equality and structural supports to facilitate reproduction and parenting among women who desire to keep their pregnancies. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Today, gamete donation and IVF are permitted not only for heterosexual couples, but also for lesbian couples and single women, and embryo donation is expected to become legalized shortly which will further increase the chances for involuntarily childless people to become parents. In recent years, the possibility of allowing surrogacy has been debated increasingly, with strongly polarized arguments both for and against it. Recent reports by the Swedish National Council of Medical Ethics and a governmental investigation agreed that the possibilities for involuntarily childless people should be increased in several ways, but reached opposing conclusions concerning surrogacy. While the former argued in favour of it (in certain circumstances), the latter argued against it (in all circumstances). One difference in their argumentation centred around the issue of bodily autonomy and self-determination in surrogacy. These two opposing conclusions raise crucial questions about what the principle of reproductive intent implies for questions concerning reproductive autonomy in surrogacy. Does it matter when in the reproductive process the declaration of intent is made, and what happens if we consider the possibility of changing intentions in relation to autonomy and self-determination in surrogacy? Is the mater est rule compatible with an intersectional, queer and non-discriminatory approach to reproductive justice, and if so, under what circumstances? Are there any possibilities of thinking beyond the ‘either/or’ between these two principles? © 2018 The Author},

Our discussion includes information, primarily from the United States, on (a) risks associated with unintended pregnancies, (b) LARC devices approved in the United States (copper intrauterine devices (IUDs), hormone IUDs, and implants), (c) public and social benefits of increasing the use of LARC, (d) disadvantages and barriers to using LARC, (e) dangers of promoting LARC in unjust ways, and (f) the meaning of reproductive justice and its connection to social justice. By sharing the information with the audience of this journal, we hope that it will be integrated into clinical work and research on mental health and development.

Drawing on three years of ethnographic research in a low-income Puerto Rican community, this article demonstrates how a gendered racial project of essentializing Latinx culture surrounding young women’s sexuality and reproduction works to both obscure and reinforce race and racism in sexual health promotion. Professional stakeholders mobilize culture as an explanation for high birth rates among young Latinas in the city and reproduce a “Latino culture narrative” in which Latina gender and sexuality is understood as deterministic and homogenous. Simultaneously, an ideology of colorblindness enables the uncritical promotion of long-acting reversible contraception and obscures the history of reproductive oppression experienced by women of color. I consider how colorblindness and culture narratives allow stakeholders to abdicate responsibility for gendered racial inequality and conclude by advocating for the incorporation of racial and reproductive justice frameworks in sexual health promotion. © 2017, © 2017 by The Author(s).},

We analyzed behavioral health data from 175 Latina immigrant participants (M age = 35; range = 18–64) of the International Latino Research Partnership (ILRP) study. We used descriptive and inferential statistics to compare immigrant mothers of minor children to those without, regarding their psychological and reproductive health, and correlates of past exposure to sexual trauma. Over one third (38%) of ILRP participants had minor children, and 58% had citizenship in their host country. The rate for sexual assault was 30 and 61%, respectively, for physical assault; these rates were similarly high for women with and without minor children. Women who reported sexual assault scored significantly higher for depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance-abuse screens. Odds of experiencing sexual assault was highest for women who experienced physical assault (odds ratio = 10.74), and for those from the Northern Triangle (odds ratio = 8.41). Subgroups of Latina migrant mothers are vulnerable to traumatic stress and related sexual and mental health risks.

It argues that rather than meeting the needs and demands of these women for access to safe contraception that they can control, the Indian state has targeted them for coercive mass sterilisations and unsafe injectable contraceptives. This is made possible by the long-term construction of particular women's lives as devalued and disposable, and of their bodies as excessively fertile and therefore inimical to development and progress. It further considers how population policy is currently embedded in the neoliberal framework of development being pursued by the Indian state. In particular, it argues that the violence of population policies is being deepened as a result of three central and interrelated aspects of this framework: corporate dispossession and displacement, the intensification and extension of women's labour for global capital, and the discourses and embodied practices of far-right Hindu supremacism. At the same time, India's population policies cannot be understood in isolation from the global population control establishment, which is increasingly corporate-led, and from broader structures of racialised global capital accumulation. The violence of India's contemporary population policies and the practices they produce operate at several different scales, all of which involve the construction of certain bodies as unfit to reproduce and requiring intervention and control. © 2018 The Feminist Review Collective.},

The utilization of an intersectional genealogical approach allows for examination of the ways in which these movements might serve as the ideological bases for a Black feminist spatial imagination and an intersectional environmental justice. A Black feminist spatial imagination is an orientation that accounts for the merger of frames around race, gender, and ecology; it serves as a unique departure from conventional Black feminist analysis by its particular attention to the construct of space in Black feminist epistemology. Analysis reveals that manifestos engage similar strategies around boundedness, an identification among a collective identity and the subject of reproductive justice and liberation as wresting control and self-determination of physical bodies. The final task is an outline of essential tenets for a singular notion of justice of a Black feminist spatial imagination which incorporates the spirit of all of three manifestos and expands current environmental justice discourse to include those ‘who know no one knows’ while highlighting Black women’s agency in environmentally degraded environments. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Feminism has long constituted itself through the struggle for sexual and reproductive justice, and Irish feminism has contributed a significant ‘legal win’ with the landslide vote of approval for lifting abortion restrictions in the referendum on the 25th May 2018. That win comes at a global moment when populist legal engagement is doing significant damage in countries that regard themselves as world leaders, and beyond. #RepealedThe8th offers Ireland, and the world, the actuality that the popular vote, and everything that contributes to it, could be something else. Repeal shows how legal tools like the vote may be made into an expression of care for reproductive lives. This expression is important in recognizing pregnant people as knowing agents who are best placed to decide, and in seeking to do justice to those who contribute to everyday reproductive life. But repeal, like the many who brought it into being, has multiple meanings. #RepealedThe8th matters because it is a moving process of socio-legal translation, which draws on a collective energy, ‘repeal energy’, to turn the travesty that was the Eighth Amendment and all it represents into a search for the rest of reproductive life. In opening up the meaning of the vote, much like feminists elsewhere have opened up the meaning of the strike, Irish feminists have turned public mourning over past mistreatment into a series of reproductive connections. This is not a strategy that can be rolled out. Figuring out #RepealedThe8th will take many tellings. Rather we need to give repeal, and repealers, room to breathe and rest. We need to feel our way through repeal’s production of legal change so that this success is not reduced to some generic transferable set of legal instructions. I begin by reflecting on repeal as a process of feminist socio-legal translation, which shows us how legal change comes about through the motivation of collective joy, the mourning of damaged and lost lives, the sharing of legal knowledge, and the claiming of the rest of reproductive life. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.},

Many Christian ethicists have either objected tout court or expressed strong reservations about the practice. Behind much of this caution, however, lies essentialist assumptions about pregnant women or an overemphasis on the statistical minority of well-publicized disasters. The question remains whether Christian ethical reflection on surrogacy might change if informed by social scientific studies on the surrogacy triad (i.e., surrogates, surrogate-born children, and intended parents). I offer a feminist Christian framework for surrogacy comprised of seven principles drawn from this literature, the reproductive justice paradigm (RJ), human rights, and Reformed theo-ethical norms (viz, covenant, fidelity, stewardship, self-gift). I ultimately advance surrogacy under certain conditions as a moral good and focus on “altruistic” arrangements-including my own-without concluding that only non-commercial contracts could pass ethical muster. © Journal of the Society of Christian Ethics},

However, reproductive rights and justice are not frequently addressed in social work publications, an important gap that should be addressed. The search term “reproductive justice” was used to identify 10 articles published between 1994 and 2018 among the top 50 social work journals (using SCImago Journal and Country rankings). Only 3 of these 10 articles focused substantively on reproductive justice. By comparison, 55 article were identified with the search term “reproductive rights.” An analysis of the reproductive justice articles was conducted for purpose and topic, location, study population, year, journal, key findings, and implications for the social work profession. All articles called for an increase in research on reproductive justice topics. Encouragingly, these articles also included an analysis of the role of the social work profession with these frameworks. However, there is a lack of articles on reproductive justice, and the range of topics, and the methodological approaches, covered are limited. Although the increase in reproductive rights literature is heartening, there is a need for reproductive justice framings in social work practice and research. © The Author(s) 2018.},

Islamic prohibitions on child adoption and third-party reproductive assistance (donor eggs, sperm, embryos, and surrogacy) mean that most Muslim couples must turn to in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) to overcome their childlessness. Attempts to bring low-cost IVF-ICSI to underserved populations might help infertile couples where no other services are available. However, a low-cost IVF-ICSI protocol for male infertility remains technically challenging and thus may result in two standards of clinical care. Nonetheless, low-cost IVF-ICSI represents a form of reproductive justice in settings with infrastructure deficits and is clearly better than no treatment at all.

Design, Setting, Participants, and Interventions: Using a mixed-method design, we conducted 30 in-person interviews with adolescent LARC users who were enrolled in school-based health centers in New York City. Interviews were conducted in 2 phases: during phase 1, 12 participants viewed a pilot version of the app (MyLARC); during phase 2, 18 additional participants interacted with an expanded version of the app. Phase 2 participants downloaded MyLARC onto their smartphone and app usage was tracked. Main Outcome Measures: Participants' responses to the in-person interviews and data usage of MyLARC from phase 2 determined the feasibility and acceptability of using MyLARC to support young women's satisfaction and continuation of LARC methods. Results: Noneducational games were recommended as an approach to provide information to adolescents in an engaging way, as well as educational graphics and visually appealing content. Data tracking of MyLARC usage among phase 2 participants revealed a total of 67 unique logins to the app with 18 average page visits per unique login. The total amount of times MyLARC was opened was 1197. The most frequented features were ‘Info about LARC’ (95 unique visits) and ‘Games’ (80 unique plays). Conclusion: A theory-based interactive smartphone app with LARC-specific information and support is an appropriate and appealing medium to provide information and support to adolescents using LARC.

The work is conducted within a framework of critical sexual and reproductive citizenship, with a focus on reproductive justice, which emphasises the contextual location of people’s reproductive rights and the limitations on these. Such a framework, as outlined in Macleod and Vincent, draws off feminist, queer, and disability theorists’ re-conceptualisation of citizenship from an inclusive and process-based understanding. The concept of citizenship has emerged as a key concept in social theory. Accordingly, D. W. Riggs and C. Due extend the notion of reproductive citizenship to consider how failures to reproduce via heterosex may compromise citizenship claims. For working-class participants, being openly gay precludes being a parent and the associated entitlements of reproductive citizenship, also evident in Andrew’s account. © 2018, 2020 University of South Africa.},

	abstract = {This essay examines the role of artificial insemination by frozen sperm and the role of the commercial sperm bank in two black feminist novels, Fran Ross's Oreo (1974) and Ntozake Shange's Sassafrass, Cypress and Indigo (1982), through an analysis of their engagement with speculative structures such as dream sequences. Oreo and Sassafrass, Cypress and Indigo were published in a social and political moment characterized by the antiracist activism of black power and black nationalism and by the gender activism of women's liberation. Ross and Shange outline a black feminist theory of reproductive science cognizant of the history of black women's reproductive exploitation, directly responding to the social movements of the 1970s that elided the specific concerns of black women. The novels demonstrate how the not-so-distant past of American slavery and the imagined near future of technologically liberated reproduction collide in the present. This essay reveals the theories of reproductive justice embedded in these novels and contextualizes their critiques within the contemporary fertility market. © University of Tulsa, 2019.

	abstract = {Effecting a paradigm shift from “reproductive health” to “reproductive justice” within the perinatal field requires changes simultaneously at the levels of the individual healthcare provider and the system of care. The Infant-Parent Program at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) has extended its pioneering infant and early childhood mental health consultation to perinatal service systems applying an infant mental health approach to programs caring for expecting and new parents. In partnership with two nursing programs, UCSF consultants direct their efforts at supporting reflective practice capacities and use-of-self in patient–provider relationships. Both nursing programs serve vulnerable groups of expectant and new parents who grapple with challenges to health and well-being stemming from structural racism. As reflective capacities are supported within the consultation case conferences, providers spontaneously identify the need for tools to effectively address issues of race, class, and culture and to combat structural racism throughout the healthcare system. Policies and procedures that uphold structural racism cease to be tolerable to providers who bring their full selves to the work that they are trained to do. Using these nurse consultation partnerships as organizational case studies, this article describes a range of challenges that arise for providers and delineates steps to effective engagement toward reproductive justice. © 2019 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health},

Method: This is a descriptive study in which in-depth interviews and discussion groups were held with all programme professionals, including a documentary review of the programme. The information was analyzed based on the Roma Health Integration Policy Index, a tool that evaluates the entitlement, accessibility, sensitivity and capacity for change of health programmes for the Roma population. Results: The professionals encountered multiple challenges to implement the family planning programme with Roma women due to the characteristics of the users and the low sensitivity of the programme towards them. The absence of specific actions for Roma women within the family planning programme, agreed to by the healthcare district, obliges professionals to develop adaptations and strategies to ensure quality sexual and reproductive health services for their users. Conclusions: It is necessary to adapt sexual and reproductive health programmes targeted at Roma women by (a) detecting, evaluating, systematizing and disseminating good practices, (b) developing actions that address the multiple vulnerabilities of Roma women, (c) acknowledging professionals who advocate for the health of these women within their organizations, and (d) promoting reproductive justice as the goal of these programmes. © 2018 SESPAS},

However, in this article, we discuss the utility and application of an intersectional/critical health communication reproductive justice method and envision its praxis in contexts like the U.S.-Mexico border. As two Chicana feminist reproductive justice/health communication scholars, our own research on reproductive feminicides throughout the U.S. and Latin America has necessitated the blending of a variety of theoretical and methodological approaches - border theories, intersectionality, Chicana feminisms, and health communication theories and methods. Thus, this essay traces the blending of these theories and methods and discusses how critical intersectional feminist health communication methods can be utilized in activist ways to resist reproductive and gendered violence at the U.S.-Mexico border. © Hernández and De Los Santos Upton.},

	abstract = {This chapter examines symphysiotomy in twentieth-century Ireland as one example of a systematized obstetric violence that has characterized Ireland's modern history. Expanding scholarly interpretations of state- and Church- inflicted abuse of women in the twentieth century, this analysis establishes the medical profession as a central actor alongside the twentieth-century state-Church coalition that regulated women's reproductive lives and engaged in systematic repression. This chapter recognizes that Ireland's history of reproductive abuse and coercion did not just involve contraception or abortion but also labor and birth experiences. In addition, it offers a more complete and complex interpretation of obstetric violence by highlighting the experiences of married women with wanted pregnancies; almost all research to date focuses on the experiences of unmarried pregnant women or unwanted pregnancies. This examination of symphysiotomy and obstetric violence in Ireland illuminates the ways in which religious, national, and medical power has been mapped on women's reproductive bodies, particularly in the decades after independence in 1922. It also makes essential links between Ireland's past and present, demonstrating that a careful analysis of the history of obstetric violence and the religious underpinnings of it are essential in understanding Ireland today. With this research, we also place symphysiotomy within the context of the global reproductive justice movement, asking how a reproductive justice framework — one that links reproductive rights with social justice — can help us interpret obstetric violence and address the wounds of Ireland’s past. © 2020 by Emerald Publishing Limited},

We employ the reproductive justice framework to demonstrate how these policies violate all 3 primary values of reproductive justice: The right to have children, the right not to have children, and the right to parent children in safe and secure environments.We argue that, when analyzed through the lens of reproductive justice, these policies can be seen as manifestations of a single targeted strategy to control the reproductive autonomy of migrants as a tool of immigration enforcement.We conclude with a call to action to the public health community. © 2020 American Public Health Association Inc..

Some potential clinical applications of IVG, such as allowing opposite-sex couples experiencing infertility to have genetically related children, have attracted support. Others, such as enabling same-sex reproduction and solo reproduction, have attracted significantly more criticism. In this paper, we examine how different ethical principles might help us to draw lines and distinguish between ethically desirable and undesirable uses of IVG. We discuss the alleged distinction between therapeutic and non-therapeutic uses of assisted reproduction in the context of IVG, and show how it is both problematic to apply in practice and theoretically dubious. We then discuss how the ethical principles of reproductive justice and beneficence apply to IVG for opposite-sex reproduction, same-sex reproduction, and solo reproduction. We suggest that these principles generate strong reasons for the use of IVG for opposite-sex and same-sex reproduction, but not for solo reproduction. © 2019 The Authors.

A reproductive justice framework provides an intersectional approach to understanding the experiences of women from varying backgrounds. Researchers conducted 52 in-depth interviews with women aged 18–44 years in rural South Carolina to understand perceived reproductive health care barriers through a reproductive justice framework. Interviews were analyzed using a constant-comparative method with qualitative data analysis software HyperRESEARCH 3.7.2. Reproductive justice served as the conceptual lens. Participants noted barriers to reproductive health care including cost, poor quality of care, and long wait times. Participants described confidentiality concerns and lack of facilities. Insufficient access to health care for women in conjunction with racial and cultural norms revealed intersectionality between gender and race. Participants reported limited autonomy over health decisions due to generational habits of not seeking care and predetermined attitudes toward health, influencing social capital and access to care. Findings suggest the need for grassroots organizing to shift the focus from reproductive rights to reproductive justice, facilitating autonomous health decisions and supportive environments to exercise decision making. Robust understandings of women's lived experiences offer insights to addressing health barriers in rural communities. © 2019 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues},

Methods: The authors conducted a prospective observational cohort study of women who gave birth over an 8-month period and requested immediate postpartum sterilization. Records of women with unfulfilled requests were reviewed up to 3 months postpartum to determine rates of postpartum follow-up and interval sterilization. Primary analysis examined unfulfilled sterilization requests associated with the Medicaid consent form and, secondarily, all other reasons for unfulfilled requests, as well as alternative contraceptive methods chosen. Results: Of the 334 women who requested immediate postpartum sterilization, 173 (52%) received the requested sterilization and 161 (48%) did not. Among those whose request was unfulfilled, 91 (56.5%) still wanted the procedure, and of those women, more than two-thirds were unable to receive it because of Medicaid consent issues. Within this group, only 6 received interval sterilization by 3 months postpartum; more than one-third received a form of long-acting reversible contraception, and 24.6% did not receive postpartum care. Discussion: A sizable proportion of women requesting postpartum sterilization have unfulfilled requests because of an issue with the Medicaid consent and also have a low likelihood of receiving interval sterilization by 3 months postpartum. The Medicaid consent may create barriers for women requesting postpartum sterilization, the vast majority of whom face subsequent barriers obtaining interval sterilization, thereby increasing the risk for unintended pregnancy in an at-risk population. This has important implications for reproductive justice efforts to protect vulnerable populations while minimizing barriers to desired care. © 2018 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.},

It is also a keystone of reproductive justice, as it has been, and continues to be, used to disempower women, for instance through forced sterilisations or contraceptive injections or through coercion by partners who confiscate pills or refuse to use a condom. Opening with a brief history of contraception through the ages and an overview of current methods, this chapter discusses the need for equal access to contraception information and services and the barriers that prevent it, including lack of reliable information and appropriately trained health professionals, cost, and cultural and religious factors. It then considers the role of contraception across the lifespan by discussing women’s experiences and the specific factors that play a role in access to and choice of contraception during adolescence, after childbirth, and during perimenopause. The chapter concludes with an agenda for further development, stressing the need for effective lower-dose and non-hormonal methods, methods that combine contraception with prevention of HIV and STIs, and methods that enhance sexual pleasure for women as well as men. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Jane M.

The World Association of Infant Mental Health [WAIMH] put out its position paper on the rights of infants in 2014 (amended in March 2016) in recognition of the human rights implications of professional understanding of infants’ unique, yet universal, developmental capacities and needs. This article links the policy issues outlined in the WAIMH position paper with critical issues in the field of reproductive justice, extending the reach of WAIMH's call to action on behalf of infants’ rights, and pointing the way toward potent alliances among interconnected movements. Connecting the dots among economic injustice, race-based health disparities, and gender inequities, the article demonstrates that it is not possible to safeguard infant mental health unless we make reproductive justice a reality. © 2019 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health},

Medolac proposed to pay women in Detroit, Michigan, to donate their excess breast milk, arguing that women would breastfeed longer and earn enough money to delay reentry into the workforce. The program spurred resistance in the city of Detroit, where critics argued that it would exploit African American mothers without considering the historical and contemporary politics of breastfeeding and the commodification of black women’s reproductive labor. Through an analysis of the organization itself, and the resistance to the initiative in Detroit, this essay argues that Medolac’s proposed program reflects the continued exploitation of the reproductive labor of women of color in the United States and encourages an individualized, neoliberal focus on health at the expense of reproductive justice. © 2018 by The University of Chicago.

On April 11, 2019, South Korea’s Constitutional Court ruled that the ban on abortion was unconstitutional. As a result, South Korea’s legislature must revise the 66-year-old anti-abortion law by December 31, 2020. This historic decision was closely related to the advocacy of a number of feminist groups, doctors’ organizations, disability rights groups, youth activists, and religious groups in South Korea, who collectively formed the Joint Action for Reproductive Justice (Joint Action) in 2017. This paper describes the activism and actions of Joint Action as a key part of reproductive justice movements in Korea. Joint Action was initiated by an organization for women with disabilities, and once formed, they worked collectively to frame abortion as a social justice issue that goes beyond the pro-choice versus pro-life binary. By focusing on the composition, strategies, and main agenda of Joint Action, this paper analyzes how Joint Action influenced the Constitutional Court’s 2019 decision to decriminalize abortion in South Korea and how the court established that it is the government’s responsibility to ensure every individual’s reproductive health and rights. © 2019 Kim, Young, and Lee.},

	abstract = {Racialized and classed “risk” narratives of sexuality in the United States construct economically marginalized young women of color as sexually precocious, potential teen mothers who are likely to end up as burdens on the state. Some scholars underline the utility of recognizing reproductive inequalities involved in constructing teen motherhood as an unequivocal social problem, and they stress the importance of exploring teen mothers’ agency in navigating dominant risk narratives. Fewer studies analyze how young women who are not pregnant or parenting produce, reproduce, and challenge dominant risk narratives about their sexuality. Drawing on three years of intensive fieldwork among 13 young economically marginalized black and Latina women, I demonstrate how feminist ideologies of empowerment interact with pervasive risk narratives in the everyday lives of marginalized women coming of age in the “shadow of the women’s movement.” My observations show that the young women strategically navigate circulating risk narratives about their sexuality by constructing an identity of distance characterized by feminist ideals of independence, self-respect, and self-development to distance themselves from these narratives. However, as they construct this identity of distance, they also stigmatize young mothers and police their own bodies and the bodies of their friends and sisters. I draw on women-of-color feminism to reflect on the uncomfortable relationship—evident in the process of a group of young women’s identity construction—between feminist ideologies of empowerment and bourgeois heteronormativity that marginalizes young women’s sexualities by constructing teen motherhood as inherently problematic. © The Author 2017.

	abstract = {Most geographers have sided with ‘cyborgs’ (technonatural subjects) against ‘goddesses’ (e.g. Mother Earth) on questions of embodiment. In itself this provides no justification for the relative dearth (in geography) of theorizing ‘with’ the uterus as a site of doing and undoing; what I propose to call uterine geography. ‘Uterine’ relations are fundamentally cyborg, animatedly labouring and not only spatial but spatializing: they make and unmake places, borders, kin. This includes not only abortion, miscarriage, menstruation and pregnancy (whose transcorporeal and chimeric character is well documented in medical anthropology) but also other life-enabling forms of holding and letting go that do not involve anatomical uteri (such as trans-mothering and other alter-familial practices). Despite our discipline’s ostensible interest in co-production, hybridity and the more-than-human, the ‘doing’ aspects of intra and interuterine processes have tended to be black-boxed in accounts of care economies and social reproduction. The proposed remedy is deromanticization: an approach that critically politicizes uterine relations as historically contingent and subject to amelioration through struggle. Potential aides include Maggie Nelson’s idea that ‘labor does you’, Suzanne Sadedin’s account of gestation’s mutual hostility and the concepts of ‘sym-poiesis’ and ‘metramorphosis’. One notable consequence of this expanded concept of the uterine is that ‘assisted reproduction’, as it is characterized today, ceases to be categorically separate from other kinds of reproduction. © The Author(s) 2018.},

Understanding additional IUD-related symptoms and how to provide counseling in a patient-centered manner can help to maintain the ongoing patient-clinician relationship and improve method satisfaction.

	abstract = {Law and Gender in Modern Ireland: Critique and Reform is the first generalist text to tackle the intersection of law and gender in this jurisdiction for over two decades. As such, it could hardly have come at a more opportune moment. The topic of law and gender, perhaps more so than at any other time in Irish history, has assumed a dominant place in political and academic debate. Among scholars and policy-makers alike, the regulation of gendered bodies, and the legal status of sexual and gendered identities, is now a highly visible fault line in public discourse. Debates over reproductive justice (exemplified by the recent referendum to remove the '8th Amendment'), increased rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons (including the public-sanctioned introduction of same-sex marriage) and the historic mistreatment of women and young girls have re-shaped Irish public and political life, and encouraged Irish society to re-examine long-unchallenged gender norms. While many traditional flashpoints remain such as abortion and prostitution/sex work, there are also new questions, including surrogacy and the gendered experience of asylum frameworks, which have emerged. As policy-makers seek to enact reforms, they face a population with increasingly polarised perceptions of gender and a legal structure ill-equipped for modern realities. This edited volume directly addresses modern Irish debates on law and gender. Providing an overview of the existing rules and standards, as well as exploring possible options for reform, the collection stands as an important statement on the law in this jurisdiction, and as an invaluable resource for pursuing gendered social change. While the edited collection applies a doctrinal methodology to explain current statutes, case law and administrative practices, the contributors also invoke critical gender, queer and race perspectives to identify and problematise existing (and potential) challenges. This edited collection is essential reading for all who are interested in law, gender and processes of social change in modern Ireland. © The editors and contributors severally 2019.

	abstract = {Queer bioethics is a latterly explicated field of bioethics developed by Lance Wahlert and Autumn Fiester, focusing on gender nonconformity and sexual diversity. Queer bioethical inquiries often involve people identifying as lesbian, gay, trans, queer or intersex (= LGBTQI) to name some of the established identity categories of such nonconformity and diversity. Topics of queer bioethical interest can include, for example, issues discussed in mainstream bioethics as gender reassignment or sex affirmation of trans- and intersex people respectively, or reproductive justice for same-sex couples accessing assisted reproduction technology. Further, however, queer bioethics interrogates the basis on which certain socio-medicalized views on gender and sexuality are justified in medical ethics, wishing to critically renegotiate these justifications to allow more human flourishing. This is also a call for dismantling the cis- and heteronormative bioethical foundations of public health. This article offers an introduction to queer bioethics accompanied by the queer bioethics inventory (QBI) formulated by Wahlert and Fiester for bioethical methodology, by focusing on the case of surrogacy in Finland. The case is selected neither because it is the most queer bioethically appalling nor because it is a rare one. On the contrary: the case has nothing explicitly to do with LGBTQI people, and allowing surrogacy as treatment is not globally uncommon. To subject a seemingly non-queer, common bioethical practice, for a queer bioethical analysis reveals the need for queer bioethics. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS},

While the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) condoned SEF based on reproductive autonomy and justice, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) discouraged SEF based on insufficient data and concerns about false hope. In this article, we map the contexts and discursive moves by which the biomedicalization of SEF proceeded since 2012. We compare professional bioethical arguments that made the case to approve SEF in Europe with news and popular media discourse that formed and shaped the commercial marketization of SEF in the United States despite the recommendation of the ASRM. While a statist pronatalist perspective informed the former, a distinctly private labor market recruitment strategy utilizing a Lean In efficiency model of feminism buttressed the latter. © The Author(s) 2018.},

	abstract = {In their article “Decolonizing Adoption Narratives for Transnational Reproductive Justice,” Sung Hee Yook and Hosu Kim examine narratives emerging from transnational adoption practices, focusing on how birth mothers’ narratives—in which a victim-mother makes choices to give a child for adoption in hopes of a better life for the child, and awaits that child’s return—develop alongside and deviate from the normative orders of motherhood. While birth mothers’ self-transformative narrative illuminates their subjectivities—apart from victimhood, simmering in the latent form of agency—Yook and Kim argue that a compelling narrative of self-mastery produces another discursive trap which renders the numerous less-masterful birth mothers invisible or unworthy of recognition. By attending to the strong affects resonating in birth mothers’ writings, we identify “transnational adoptive kinship” as a new sociality, which emerges out of mutual recognition and acknowledgment of adoption losses. In doing so, we envision a new terrain for a transnational reproductive justice framework. © Purdue University.},

Mass incarceration, by its very nature, compromises and undermines bodily autonomy and the capacity for incarcerated people to make decisions about their reproductive wellbeing and bodies; this is done through institutionalized racism and is disproportionately done to the bodies of women of color. This violates the most basic tenets of reproductive justice—the right to have a child, not to have a child, and to parent the children you have with dignity and in safety. By undermining motherhood and safe pregnancy care, denying access to abortion and contraception, and preventing people from parenting their children at all and by doing so in overpoliced, unsafe environments, mass incarceration has become a driver of forms of reproductive oppression for people in prison and jails and in the community. © The Author(s), 2020.},

The concept of environmental reproductive justice (ERJ), or ensuring that environmental issues do not interfere with physical or cultural reproduction, involves expanding reproductive justice to include a deeper focus on the environment, and to include the reproduction of language and culture as concerns, in addition to the reproduction of human beings. ERJ also aims to expand the framework of environmental justice to more closely consider the impact of environmental contaminants on physical and cultural reproduction. Through the example of Akwesasne, a Mohawk American Indian community located downstream from industrial sites on the New York/Canadian border, this paper explores how the concept of ERJ can be utilized to understand the unique situation of American Indian communities who are arguing that justice necessitates going beyond equal protection. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Drawing on intra-categorical intersectionality, the supportability aspect starts from the event of a pregnancy to unravel the interwoven embodied and social realities implicated in women experiencing pregnancy as personally supportable/unsupportable, and socially supported/unsupported. The reparative justice aspect highlights the need for social repair in the case of unsupportable pregnancies and relies on Ernesto Verdeja’s critical theory of reparative justice in which he outlines four reparative dimensions. Using abortion within the South African context, I show how this framework may be put to use: (1) the facilitation of autonomous decision-making (individual material dimension) requires understanding women within context, and less emphasis on individual-driven ‘choice’; (2) the provision of legal, safe state-sponsored healthcare resources (collective material dimension) demands political will and abortion service provision to be regarded as a moral as well as a healthcare priority; (3) overcoming stigma and the spoiled identities (collective symbolic dimension) requires significant feminist action to deconstruct negative discourses and to foreground positive narratives; and (4) understanding individual lived experiences (individual symbolic dimension) means deep listening within the social dynamics of particular contexts. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

In this article, I suggest that a fruitful starting point for a conversation on how to tackle such a challenge is to examine the way in which surrogacy is conceptualized. Thus, I examine how scholars have queried surrogacy, asking how different conceptualizations of who this reproductive phenomenon concerns have led to the formulations of different types of ‘troubles’ of surrogacy. I delineate three different conceptualizations of surrogacy. Firstly, how surrogacy as a way to make parents has troubled scholars because of the conflation of reproduction with consumption, thereby making reproduction a matter of financial resource. Secondly, the trouble emerging when surrogacy is conceptualized as baby-making relates to how surrogacy turns babies and bodies into commodities. Thirdly, surrogacy understood as a phenomenon that concerns the women gestating and birthing the children has brought attention to issues of exploitation. These different formulations of trouble point towards tensions in the literature, while also offering reminders that surrogacy is not one thing alone; a finding that provides an opening for new forms of reproductive justice. This brings me to propose a rethinking of the notion of ‘reproductive assistance’ arguing in favour of moving away from substitution and transaction towards a relational being-together. © 2018 The Author},

The pandemic has exacerbated problems in access to abortion services because social distancing or lockdown measures, increasing caring responsibilities, and the need to self-isolate are making clinics much more difficult to access, and this is when clinics are able to stay open which many are not. In response we argue there is a need to facilitate telemedical early medical abortion in order to ensure access to essential healthcare for people in need of terminations. There are substantial legal barriers to the establishment of telemedical abortion services in parts of GB and parts of the US. We argue that during a pandemic any restriction on telemedicine for basic healthcare is an unjustifiable human rights violation and, in the US, is unconstitutional.  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

	abstract = {Distance—physical, material distance—is an obviously spatial concept, but one rarely engaged by legal or feminist geographers. We take up this oversight in relation to the 2016 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, which adjudicated the constitutionality of a Texas law that imposed new regulations on abortion providers. Because half of the state’s abortion providers were unable to meet these regulations and thus closed, the distance that many Texas women had to travel for abortion services increased dramatically. In part because of these increases, the Supreme Court ultimately determined that the Texas laws imposed an unconstitutional “undue burden.” Bringing together case law and ethnographic data, this article traces the process by which distance is made legally “legible” in the context of reproductive injustice. In so doing, it confronts more uneasy realities of distance, including the discursive dismissal of social and literal immobility and isolation; contradictory readings of “emptiness”; and the material spatiality of distance through the nonplace-ness of rural areas. Together, these factors illuminate a more significant distance, namely the epistemic and social distance that exists between the legal performance of distance in litigation and the embodied traversal of distance by a woman seeking an abortion in Texas. Prioritizing rural distance as material, legal and gendered, our work engages and augments the nascent field of feminist legal geographies. It likewise challenges legal geographers’ insistence on urban space by uncovering the ways in which even the relative “emptiness” of distance is intimately consequential. Finally, this paper makes connections between the exercise of the abortion right and the exercise of other rights that implicate distance, most notably the right to vote. Just as abortion regulations have often had the effect of requiring women to travel farther for abortion services, voter ID laws have the effect of requiring voters to travel to a public agency in order to secure the requisite identity document. Other voting regulations and state and local voting practices may similarly impose spatial burdens on voters. We thus assert that what Whole Woman’s Health reveals about making distance legally cognizable finds ready legal application in other contexts. © The Author(s) 2018.},

This vantage point of egg providers can help lend important insights into the wider processes of family-making across borders today. It centres on ethnographic research conducted on contemporary cross-border egg provision performed by female migrant workers in Spain. Through this intersectional perspective, we stand to gain deeper insights into cross-border reproduction more widely. Egg provision can be a way for migrant women to gain temporary financial benefit. In a system that does not provide equal access for migrants to work and care, female migrants make themselves extractable commodities. As such, they are both a commodity and a worker at the same time. The example of female migrant workers providing eggs can be used to reflect more generally on egg provision, and on cross-border reproduction and reproductive justice models as used in queer cross-border family-building. Taken within the broader framework of reproductive justice, and with the struggles of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender cross-border reproduction in mind, the paper begins by asking how three intersecting inequalities due to (1) migration/citizenship, (2) joblessness/contract working and (3) race facilitate the industry of cross-border reproduction? In what ways do female migrant workers mobilize their reproductive potential, including time, whiteness, other racial/phenotypic similarity to commissioning parents, and unstable work lives in cross-border egg donation? The paper ends with an argument for focusing analytical and political attention on the needs of those providing eggs; the most prized material resources for cross-border reproduction. © 2018},

Taking as given that gay men have the same ethical right to pursue such reproductive technologies as heterosexual couples or individuals, this article asks whether access to egg donation and surrogacy for gay men specifically could be considered a matter not just of (consumer)rights, but of justice. The idea of shifting discourse about reproduction from the language of ‘rights’ to that of ‘justice’ is most notably articulated by women of colour. Their call for reproductive justice seeks to expand discussion beyond the narrow right to an abortion (as a negative privacy right)to encompass broader, positive rights, such as the rights to bear healthy children and to raise them in safe environments. What, if anything, might we learn from reproductive justice movements about how to frame gay men's desire/demand for access to surrogacy? While I find several productive connections between the two groups, two factors lead me to argue against understanding gay access to surrogacy as a matter of justice: first, the necessary reliance on women's reproductive labour; and second, the largely non-structural causes of gay couples' inability to reproduce. Nevertheless, by considering two driving forces behind gay male assisted reproduction – social norms favouring biological family formation and the need for family security – I ultimately conclude that a basis for solidarity exists between gay men and reproductive justice movements. That basis is a concept like ‘procreative liberty’. © 2018 The Author},

This article examines what a reproductive justice perspective contributes to infant mental health work with teenage mothers and their families. It explores the historical framing of teenage pregnancy in which young mothers are the cause of a variety of social problems and in which the primary policy and practice approach is pregnancy prevention. The article offers alternative framings of teenage childbearing, based on reproductive justice principles, which focus on social conditions surrounding teenage parenthood and the meaning of motherhood in the lives of young women. These alternative frames shift the practice agenda to eradicating unjust social conditions and providing supports for young women in their roles as parents. The article then describes ways in which two infant mental health programs have incorporated reproductive justice principles into their work with young families: Chicago's community doula model and Florida's Young Parents Project for court-involved teenage parents.

	abstract = {Tracing a line from popular eugenicist and racist reproductive control policies of the past century, this paper argues that contemporary Western discourses of pregnancy fatness perpetuate and amplify reproductive injustices endured by minority women, particularly socio-economically disadvantaged women of color and Indigenous women. Drawing on in-depth semi-structured interviews conducted in Aotearoa New Zealand with 12 self-identified fat, cis-gendered, Indigenous Māori women and women from the Pacific, we demonstrate how contemporary discourses about pregnancy fatness are racialized, constituting oppressive meanings about fat Māori and Pacific women’s unsuitability to reproduce and to mother. We demonstrate how such oppressive meanings perpetuate the harmful relations of colonization and reproduce legacies of reproductive injustice by disrupting Indigenous and other cultural epistemologies of reproduction, and undermining reproductive self-determination. We draw on the intersectional lens of reproductive justice, as articulated by women of color scholars and activists, to demand a much more complex and socially just view of the relationship between fatness, reproductive health and mothering. This view moves beyond individual blame and sanction to attend to the impact of discursive, structural and colonizing threats to maternal and child health, indeed to population health. It also restores and supports the dignity of women of color in their transition to parenthood by centering Indigenous and other cultural epistemologies of reproduction that intrinsically value their human existence and contextualize maternal belonging in a wider network of relationships. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {In response to a recent surge of openly misogynistic political discourses at the highest levels of government, a vibrant wave of hashtag feminism across the Americas evidences women’s widespread concerns over their bodily and territorial rights. Engaging Twitter and Facebook as digital archives-of-the-present, in conjunction with ethnographic interviews and surveys conducted in Peru and in the United States, we analyze protest symbols in two high-profile women’s rights movements: the United States #WomensMarch and the Peruvian #NiUnaMenos March. For Native women in both movements, the land grabs perpetrated by state and corporate actors factored as heavily into their resistance motivations as did their concerns over bodily rights and reproductive justice, which were the central concerns of non-Native women respondents. In the United States, the majority of protesters used the pussyhat as an organizing principle to react against politicians’ allusions to the physical abuse of women and their policy-driven threats to reproductive choice; meanwhile, some Native women donned the warbonnet scarf to recognize their intersectional oppressions under Donald Trump. In the Peruvian context, women across the nation took to city streets with blood red paint dripping down their thighs to provoke social memory of a recent era of forced sterilizations under Alberto Fujimori. In the Andean highlands, Aymara and Quechua women invoked the Pachamama, or Earth Mother, as a vibrant ally to aid in their battle against threats to their bodily sovereignty and the ongoing destruction of indigenous landscapes. Within these two hashtag movements, we find a pattern of mainstream communications that emphasize body as territory, while indigenous protest symbols focus not only on who is being grabbed—but where. © 2019 by Author/s and Licensed by Lectito BV, Netherlands.},

Childbirth is often cited as the paradigmatic instance of this kind of beneficial pain. This essay examines conceptualizations of labour pain in biomedical, natural childbirth and reproductive justice movements that explore the limits of Scarry’s description of pain as ‘unshareable’. Political struggles over pain in childbirth centre on the legibility of pain in labour. Feminist and natural childbirth activists have developed an understanding of pain at birth as central to maternal subjectivity, where pain is a biopolitical force and its management a means of self-transformation. Alongside calls for reproductive justice, the essay considers how the visibility and expressivity of labour pain could contribute to what Imogen Tyler and Lisa Baraitser term a new ‘natal politics’ that addresses concerns for the disproportionate injury and death experienced by Black birth givers. © The Author(s) 2019.},

	abstract = {Cervical cancer is a preventable disease. HPV infection has been linked to more than 90% of cervical cancers. A vaccine to prevent the acquisition of HPV has been available since 2006. The purpose of this study was to investigate women's perceptions of cervical cancer prevention, including HPV vaccination. A reproductive justice framework guided data collection and analysis. In 2016, researchers conducted 70 in-depth, semi-structured qualitative interviews with women aged 19–78 years in South Carolina. A purposive sampling approach was employed to maximize requisite variety based on social, economic, and environmental axes of inequality. Participants self-identified as white (53%), African American (33%), and Hispanic (9%). Data analysis included an inductive constant comparative method to identify patterns and themes across the interviews. Misinformation about the prevalence and risk of HPV and cervical cancer led to “othering” of women with HPV-related diagnoses based on the flawed assumption of not being at risk. Participants described a lack of knowledge about the effectiveness and safety of the HPV vaccine. Social norms influenced participants' perceptions of HPV vaccination and cervical cancer, including concerns about sexual activity and intergenerational communication. Participants’ social construction of identity, including race/ethnicity, socioeconomic position, ability, age, gender, sexual orientation, and immigration status, impacted their perceptions of cervical cancer screening and the HPV vaccine. In particular, participants believed that the HPV vaccine was “only for girls” and identified gender norms that limited uptake. Participants described barriers to accessing health care and cervical cancer screening, including cost, health insurance, and life changes (e.g., pregnancy, relocating). Many participants experienced an abnormal Papanicolaou test and described follow-up care, including biopsies and treatment for cervical dysplasia. Findings from this study offer insight into women's identity and perceptions of cervical cancer prevention. Results provide practical recommendations to increase women's agency in the development of successful public health interventions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

I suggest that two threads connect these various aspects of reproductive politics: the commitment to self-determination, and an expanded understanding of kinship beyond the nuclear and the biological. These two themes stand in complicated tension – visible in debates over the ethics of surrogacy, for instance, and in the ways that queer family-making is facilitated, in part, by class and racial inequalities – that need to be confronted head-on. I conclude with some examples of what political kinship built around family justice can and does look like at the level of concrete action. © 2018},

	abstract = {Reproductive justice and gestational surrogacy are often implicitly treated as antonyms. Yet the former represents a theoretic approach that enables the long and racialised history of surrogacy (far from a new or ‘exceptional’ practice) to be appreciated as part of a struggle for ‘radical kinship’ and gender-inclusive polymaternalism. Recasting surrogacy as a dynamic contradiction in itself, full of latent possibilities relevant to early Reproductive Justice militants’ family-abolitionist aims, this article invites scholars in human geography and cognate disciplines to re-think the boundaries of surrogacy politics. As ethnographies of formal gestational workplaces, accounts of gestational workers’ self-organised resistance, and readings of the attendant public media scandals show (taking examples from India, Thailand, and New Jersey), there is no good reason to place these new economies of ‘third-party reproductive assistance’ in a ‘realm apart’ from conversations about social reproduction more generally. Surrogacy, I argue, potentially names a practice of commoning at the same time as it names a new wave of accumulation in which clinicians are capitalising on the contemporary–biogenetic-propertarian, white-supremacist–logic of kinmaking in the Global North. Ongoing experiments in the redistribution of mothering labour (‘othermothering’ in the Black feminist tradition) suggest that ‘another surrogacy is possible’, animated by what Kathi Weeks and the 1970s intervention ‘Wages Against Housework’ conceive as anti-work politics. In making this argument, the article revives the concept ‘gestational labour’ as a means of keeping the process of ‘literal’ reproduction open to transformation. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

It highlights the tensions between risk discourse and broader equity goals, which are increasingly seen as significant within sexual and reproductive health. Working within a poststructuralist perspective, discursive methodology is used to explore the positioning of youth in ten (10) policy documents. The analysis shows how the risk discourse, along with a developmental discourse, creates three common youth subject positions: youth as at risk and vulnerable, as not-yet citizens, and as especially vulnerable relative to other young people. It demonstrates how these positions may be associated with ‘new’ or covert forms of morality and stigmatisation. Detailing the implications for ethnic minorities in particular, it adds to prior analyses of gender- and class-based inequities. The Sexual and Reproductive Justice framework, which encompasses notions of rights and justice, is discussed as an alternative to risk-based policy development that can attend to sexual and reproductive health inequities. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Often, they are specific ‘soundworks’ which, though still emphasizing speech and words over sound and noise, still challenge the predominance of text and image by necessitating the ‘social act’ of listening. Not by Accident, ‘a documentary series about choosing to become a single mother and coping with being one’ (Harper), presents an example of how private and intimate stories, told to an (anonymous) audience can function as both scriptotherapy, and oral/aural (auto)biographical texts (here of mother and daughter), but also as self-help and awareness raising narratives for a community of listeners, a sound-based social network. By illustrating the private impact of public family policies and social discourses, Harper’s podcast speaks against discrimination and denigration of single mothers, lesbian mothers and single mothers by choice, against patriarchal motherhood and the heteronormative model of the ‘nuclear family’ and for reproductive justice in families of choice. © 2019 Intellect Ltd Article.

	abstract = {The over-reliance on incarceration in the USA is a racialized phenomenon which has affected millions of families – disproportionately people of colour – reconfiguring kinship around the criminal legal system. Mass incarceration, then, disrupts conventional modes of reproduction and threatens reproductive justice, separates families and funnels children into foster care, diverts funds from social services into prisons, restricts women's access to abortion and adequate pregnancy care, shackles women in childbirth, and incarcerates people during their prime reproductive years. Beyond these obvious disruptions to reproduction, incarceration also cultivates certain ways of being a parent. Much of the critical literature on mass incarceration focuses on men, largely because of fewer women and masculinist assumptions of the carceral system. This paper looks specifically at how women's reproduction is experienced and managed by carceral institutions, and how mass incarceration itself is a reproductive technology. Based on ethnographic fieldwork at a women's jail, I explore pregnancy and motherhood behind bars. Certain types of mothering are foreclosed, while an idealized version of maternal identity is simultaneously promoted. For many incarcerated women, jail is the only place where they can experience this form of motherhood, as forces of structural violence outside of jail often limit their ability to parent, such as involvement of child welfare institutions, addiction and homelessness. The myriad ways in which incarcerated women's reproduction is suppressed and enabled is a critical lens through which to understand how institutions and forces of racial oppression reinforce idealized notions of motherhood while making them categorically unattainable. © 2018 The Author},

Since birth experiences are better studied, birth stories are more readily shared and many women who have had an abortion have also given birth, we sought to compare women's needs and preferences in abortion to those in birth. We conducted semi-structured intensive interviews with women who had both experiences in the United States and analyzed their intrapartum and abortion care narratives using grounded theory, identifying needs and preferences in abortion that were distinct from birth. Based on interviews with twenty women, three themes emerged: to be affirmed as moral decision-makers, to be able to determine their degree of awareness during the abortion, and to have care provided in a discreet manner to avoid being judged by others for having an abortion. These findings suggest that some women have distinctive emotional needs and preferences during abortion care, likely due to different circumstances and sociopolitical context of abortion.

	abstract = {In 2015, the birth rate among U.S. adolescents and young adults (aged 15–19 years) reached a historic low at 22.3 per 1,000 women. Despite positive trends, the United States continues to have the highest adolescent pregnancy rate among industrialized countries with data. Racial and ethnic disparities in adolescent pregnancy rates continue to exist, as do state-based differences in pregnancy, birth, and abortion rates. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists supports access for adolescents to all contraceptive methods approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In the absence of contraindications, patient choice should be the principal factor in prescribing one method of contraception over another. Dual method use—the use of condoms in combination with more effective contraceptive methods to protect against sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancy—is the ideal contraceptive practice for adolescents. Just as adolescents should have access to the full range of contraceptives, including long-acting reversible contraceptive methods, they should be able to decline and discontinue any method on their own, without barriers. A reproductive justice framework for contraceptive counseling and access is essential to providing equitable health care, accessing and having coverage for contraceptive methods, and resisting potential coercion by health care providers. Successful programs that resulted in measurable changes in adolescent contraceptive practices and sexual behavior have been described, but not implemented uniformly nor supported by policy improvements. More research is needed to determine which programs are most effective and which programs do not work. Continued efforts are integral to further advance positive trends. © by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.},

We introduce four case studies with a focus on the ways in which restrictions on SRH differentially affect individuals across dimensions of social inequality including race, class, and sexual orientation. Next, we assess the state of scholarship on SRH in counseling psychology. Finally, we offer an action plan for incorporating reproductive justice principles into counseling psychology. © Division of Counseling Psychology of the American Psychological Association.},

	abstract = {Many authors have argued that sex-selective abortion (SSA) poses a problem for defenders of reproductive choice: the notion that a woman has “freely chosen” to abort a female fetus becomes problematic when she faces compelling pressure to bear a male child. This argument reflects the broader concern of the reproductive justice movement that mainstream pro-choice discourse has defined “choice”in narrow, legalistic terms, and overlooks the barriers to reproductive choice often faced by poor women and women of color. This article examines recent debates surrounding a proposed ban on SSA in the United Kingdom. It finds that despite attempts by the ban’s proponents to make intersectional claims around gender, ethnicity, and class, their arguments also invoke xenophobia by constructing Indian migrants as a threat to “British” values of gender equality. Thus, the article suggests that the concept of disarticulation may fruitfully be used to make sense of such “intersectional” claims. © 2015 Caucus for a New Political Science.},

Although sterilization is among the most straightforward surgical procedures an obstetrician–gynecologist performs, it is enormously complex when considered from a historical, sociological, or ethical perspective. Sterilization practices have embodied a problematic tension, in which some women who desired fertility were sterilized without their knowledge or consent, and other women who wanted sterilization to limit their family size lacked access to it. An ethical approach to the provision of sterilization must, therefore, promote access for women who wish to use sterilization as a method of contraception, but at the same time safeguard against coercive or otherwise unjust uses. This Committee Opinion reviews ethical issues related to the sterilization of women and outlines an approach to providing permanent sterilization within a reproductive justice framework that recognizes that all women have a right to pursue and to prevent pregnancy. © by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.},

In this paper two major political positions regarding abortion in Africa: a de-colonisation approach based on a homogenized view of ―culture‖, and a liberal approach based on ―choice‖ and rights are outlined. Using the Questions and Answers sessions of a United Nations event on maternal health in Africa as an exemplar of these positions, the paper argues that neither approach is emancipatory in the African context. A de-colonisation approach that uses static and homogenized understanding of ‗culture‘ risks engaging in a politics of representation that potentially silences the ―Other‖ (in this case women who terminate their pregnancies) and glosses over complexities and multiple power relations that exist on the continent. A liberal approach, premised on choice and reproductive rights, risks foregrounding individual women‘s agency at the expense of contextual dynamics, including the conditions that create unsupportable pregnancies. The paper argues for a grounded reproductive justice perspective that draws on the insights of the reproductive justice movement, but grounds these notions within the African philosophy of Hunhu/Ubuntu. © 2018, Women's Health and Action Research Centre.

Rather than offer another ideographic argument in support of <choice>, this study uncovers why the term fails to translate culturally and linguistically and how this incompatibility necessitates a language alternative: reproductive justice (or justicia reproductiva in Spanish). Introduced in 1994 by U.S. Black feminist activists, this term fuses reproductive rights with social justice to provide a framework for communicating the intersecting inequalities encountered by Women of Color and the poor. This essay contends that <choice>advances White, monolingual feminism, while eliding and even erasing more precarious positionalities and perspectives. Such a tendency impedes coalition building among Third-World and other feminists. The article concludes by encouraging communication scholars to recognize and resist U.S. monoculturalism and English monolingualism, which heretofore have circumscribed our research. © 2015, Copyright The Organization for Research on Women and Communication.},

	abstract = {Health law is in the midst of a dramatic transformation. From a relatively narrow discipline focused on regulating relationships among individual patients, health care providers, and third-party payers, it is expanding into a far broader field with a burgeoning commitment to access to health care and assurance of healthy living conditions as matters of social justice. Through a series of incremental reform efforts stretching back decades before the Affordable Care Act and encompassing public health law as well as the law of health care financing and delivery, reducing health disparities has become a central focus of American health law and policy. This Article labels, describes, and furthers a nascent "health justice" movement by examining what it means to view health law as an instrument of social justice. Drawing on the experiences of the reproductive justice, environmental justice, and food justice movements, and on the writings of political philosophers and ethicists on health justice, I propose that health justice offers an alternative to the market competition and patient rights paradigms that currently dominate health law scholarship, advocacy, and reform. I then examine the role of law in reducing health disparities through the health justice lens. I argue that the nascent health justice framework suggests three commitments for the use of law to reduce health disparities. First, to a broader inquiry that views access to health care as one among many social determinants of health deserving of public attention and resources. Second, to probing inquiry into the effects of class, racial, and other forms of social and cultural bias on the design and implementation of measures to reduce health disparities. And third, to collective action grounded in community engagement and participatory parity. In exploring these commitments, I highlight tensions within the social justice framework and between the social justice framework and the nascent health justice movement. These tensions illustrate, rather than undermine, the power of viewing health law as social justice. They raise important questions that should prompt more fruitful and rigorous thinking within health law activism and scholarship and with regard to the relationships between law and social justice more broadly.},

Harold Ellens lead readers through a detailed exploration of the feminist methods, issues, and theoretical frameworks that have made women central, not marginal, to religions around the world. At a conference in 2013, Gloria Steinem noted that religion is the “biggest problem” facing feminism today. In this insightful volume, a team of researchers, psychologists, and religious leaders led by editors Michele A. Paludi and J. Harold Ellens supply their expertise and informed opinions to examine the problems, spur understanding, and pose solutions to the conflicts between religion and women’s rights, thereby advocating a global interest in justice and love for women. Examples of subjects addressed include the pro-life/pro-choice debate, feminism in new age thought, and the complex intersections of religion and feminism combined with gender, race, and ethnicity. The contributed work in this unique single-volume book enables a better understanding of how various religions view women-both traditionally and in the modern context-and how feminist thinking has changed the roles of women in some world religions. Readers will come away with clear ideas about how religious cultures can honor feminist values, such as family-friendly workplace policies, reproductive justice, and pay equity, and will be prepared to engage in conversation and constructive debate regarding how faith and feminism are interrelated today. © 2016 by Michele A.

By drawing on transnational feminism, transculturalism, intersectionality, and reproductive justice frameworks, it illuminates the similarities and variance in past and contemporary studies of reproductive politics. The editors explain the importance of complicating the many histories and ongoing politics of abortion by situating them within the broader conditions in which women make decisions about whether or not to terminate a pregnancy. The introduction demonstrates that putting conversations about abortion and contraception, reproduction, and personhood alongside one another in this multidisciplinary fashion creates a more nuanced understanding of reproductive health. © The Author(s) 2017.},

These studies have been sensationally reported in the Australasian news media, resulting in a reorientation of public health policy toward the management and prevention of ‘risky’ fat pregnant bodies. This article draws on Foucauldian governmentality theory and intersectional analysis to argue that the framing of ‘maternal obesity’ as a public health crisis represents a gendered, raced and classed biopolitical technology of governance with implications for fat women who reproduce, and for social justice in health more generally. It concludes by arguing for the potential of the intersectional concept of reproductive justice to provide a more complex and socially just view of the relationship between maternal body weight and reproductive health outcomes. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Linear regressions indicated that students’ endorsements of permissive sexual attitudes and support for birth control are inversely associated with holding anti-choice abortion views. Moreover, distinct relationships were found among sociodemographic characteristics and abortion attitudes and knowledge, suggesting that social work education efforts regarding contentious reproductive and sexual health topics should also focus on nuances of cultural competence and diversity, as well as general human rights principles and professional ethics.

Looking specifically at dynamics of funding and compulsion, this chapter elucidates how reliance on the rhetoric of individual choice as an expression of freedom rewards those with the greatest access to resources and fails to make sure that all members of the community have the resources to shape their own outcomes or to make sure collective health is protected.

	abstract = {Purpose of review Quality contraceptive counseling has been identified as a potential means to reduce unintended pregnancy and to increase contraceptive continuation and satisfaction. Past approaches that focused on autonomous decision making and directive counseling have not been shown to meet these goals consistently. Women's health organizations globally are calling for improved counseling through more thorough discussion of side-effects and bleeding changes, and renewed focus on shared decision making and patient-centered care. Recent findings Reproductive life planning can help initiate contraceptive counseling but does not resonate with all patients. A client-centered approach using shared decision making, building trust, and eliciting client preferences has been shown to increase satisfaction and continuation. Patient preferences vary widely and may or may not prioritize extremely high effectiveness. Decision support tools have mixed results, but generally can help improve the method choice process when they are well designed. Summary Clinicians should strive for good interpersonal relationships with patients, and elicit patient experiences and preferences to tailor their counseling to each individual's needs. Shared decision making with input from both the patient and clinician is preferred by many women, and clinicians should be cognizant of perceptions of pushing any method too strongly, especially among marginalized populations. More research on long-Term satisfaction and continuation linked to different counseling practices is needed. Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Why is the sexuality of people with intellectual disabilities often deemed “risky” or “inappropriate” by teachers, parents, support staff, medical professionals, judges, and the media? Should sexual citizenship depend on IQ? Confronting such questions head-on, Already Doing It exposes the “sexual ableism” that denies the reality of individuals who, despite the restrictions they face, actively make decisions about their sexual lives. Tracing the history of efforts in the United States to limit the sexual freedoms of such persons?using methods such as forced sterilization, invasive birth control, and gender-segregated living arrangements—Michael Gill demonstrates that these widespread practices stemmed from dominant views of disabled sexuality, not least the notion that intellectually disabled women are excessively sexual and fertile while their male counterparts are sexually predatory. Analyzing legal discourses, sex education materials, and news stories going back to the 1970s, he shows, for example, that the intense focus on “stranger danger” in sex education for intellectually disabled individuals disregards their ability to independently choose activities and sexual partners—including nonheterosexual ones, who are frequently treated with heightened suspicion. He also examines ethical issues surrounding masturbation training that aims to regulate individuals’ sexual lives, challenges the perception that those whose sexuality is controlled (or rejected) should not reproduce, and proposes recognition of the right to become parents for adults with intellectual disabilities. A powerfully argued call for sexual and reproductive justice for people with intellectual disabilities, Already Doing It urges a shift away from the compulsion to manage “eviance” (better known today as harm reduction) because the right to pleasure and intellectual disability are not mutually exclusive. In so doing, it represents a vital new contribution to the ongoing debate over who, in the United States, should be allowed to have sex, reproduce, marry, and raise children. © 2015 by the Regents of the University of Minnesota.

This project aimed to identify core competencies to guide SRH training across the primary care professions. Study design: A six-member interprofessional expert working group drafted SRH competencies for primary care team members. Primary care providers including family physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners and certified nurse midwives, physician assistants and pharmacists were invited to participate in a three-round electronic Delphi survey. In each round, participants voted by email to retain, eliminate or revise each competency, with their suggested edits to the competencies incorporated by the researchers after each round. Results: Fifty providers from six professions participated. In Round 1, 17 of 33 draft competencies reached the 75% predetermined agreement level to be accepted as written. Five were combined, reducing the total number to 28. Based on Round 2 feedback, 21 competencies were reworded, and 2 were combined. In Round 3, all 26 competencies reached at least 83.7% agreement, with 9 achieving 100% agreement. Conclusion: The 33 core competencies encompass professional ethics and reproductive justice, collaboration, SRH services and conditions affecting SRH. These core competencies will be disseminated and adapted to each profession's scope of practice to inform required curricula. Implications: SRH competencies for primary care can inform the required curricula across professions, filling the gap between an established standard of care necessary to meet patient needs and the outcomes of that care. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

It is a qualitative study, informed by policy review and key informant interviews. Three case studies provide evidence of what is happening on the ground in relation to ICTs and reproductive health and rights. We argue that in terms of policy, there is little overlap between health rights and communication technology. In the area of practice, however, significant interventions address aspects of reproductive health. At present, the extent to which mHealth addresses the full range of reproductive justice and sexual and reproductive health and rights is limited, particularly in terms of government initiatives. The paper argues that mHealth projects tend to avoid contentious aspects of sexual health, while addressing favourable topics such as pregnancy and motherhood. The ways in which information is framed in mHealth mirrors current gaps within sexual and reproductive health and rights, where a limited and conservative lens predominates, and which may result in narrow programming and implementation of services. © 2015 Reproductive Health Matters.},

Although sterilization is among the most straightforward surgical procedures an obstetrician-gynecologist performs, it is enormously complex when considered from a historical, sociological, or ethical perspective. Sterilization practices have embodied a problematic tension, in which some women who desired fertility were sterilized without their knowledge or consent, and other women who wanted sterilization to limit their family size lacked access to it. An ethical approach to the provision of sterilization must, therefore, promote access for women who wish to use sterilization as a method of contraception, but at the same time safeguard against coercive or otherwise unjust uses. This Committee Opinion reviews ethical issues related to the sterilization of women and outlines an approach to providing permanent sterilization within a reproductive justice framework that recognizes that all women have a right to pursue and to prevent pregnancy.},

Feminists are, however, increasingly using a broader framework of ‘reproductive justice’, which considers the intersecting conditions that serve to enhance or hinder women’s reproductive freedoms, including their capacities to decide about the outcome of their pregnancies. Nonetheless, reproductive justice approaches to abortion are, conceptually, relatively under-developed. We introduce a reparative justice approach as a method of further articulating the concept of reproductive justice. We first explain how this approach can be used to conceptualise safe, accessible and supportive abortion as a key element of reproductive justice in relation to the injustice of unwanted or unsupportable pregnancies. Using Ernesto Verdeja’s critical theory of reparative justice and case studies of two countries (South Africa and Great Britain) where abortion is legal, we show how such an approach enables an analysis of reproductive justice within the specificities of particular contexts. We argue that both the rights-based legal framework adopted in South Africa and the medicalised approach of British law have, in practice, limited reparative justice in these contexts. We discuss the implications of reparative justice for abortion advocacy. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Drawing on Canadian Catholic nuns’ unique accounts of their experiences with the Roman Catholic Church, this chapter brings nuance to the complicated power dynamics navigated by women religious to show how women remain excluded and exploited in various ways in their own religious institutions. We point to the institutionalized Roman Catholic Church’s long-standing control over women’s reproductive rights, as well as its ongoing prohibition and recent criminalization of women’s ordination. We also address recent structural dynamics at play by drawing attention to a recent Vatican investigation and ongoing surveillance of women religious in North America under newly established church doctrine. We view these recent tactics as evidence of the Vatican’s renewed commitment to existing gender hierarchies within the Church. Feminist intervention is especially important considering this deepening patriarchal power and how, by extension, the church is regressing rather than progressing towards gender equality, even while it shows evidence of shifting attitudes on other social issues. This chapter also underscores the implications of a global religious institution for women in Canada. © 2018 Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Based upon community-engaged qualitative research, from a participatory action research approach, including field immersion, participant observation and 35 in-depth interviews with First Nations residents, I document the Aamjiwnaang First Nation’s citizens’ activities and practices on the ground as they cope with the impact of their contaminated surroundings on their health and habitat. This community-engaged scholarship lens brings into view the lived experiences and ongoing practices of resistance by the Anishinabek citizens who are surrounded by Chemical Valley. I situate these struggles within the green citizenship literature to assess three blind spots of green governmentality: greening citizenship, lifestyle blame and Western dualisms. I discuss the multiple edges of ecological citizenship and argue that citizens are simultaneously bound up within disciplinary power relations and place-based belonging. This place, although polluted, is crucial to practices of relational Anishinabek citizenship and the identity of indigenous citizens who call this place both ‘prison and home’. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

It is within these controversies as well as local social dynamics that public SRH interventions aimed at adolescents take place. I start this chapter with an outline of the major global public health approach to adolescent SRH: the health and human rights framework. I then briefly overview some of the key issues concerning sexuality education, contraception, pregnancy, abortion, HIV, and lesbian, gay, bisexual (LGB) issues among adolescents, concentrating on questions surrounding taken-for-granted assumptions and health injustices. With this as a backdrop, I argue for a sexual and reproductive justice approach that draws from transnational feminism. Such an approach would focus on health injustices, analyze gendered power relations that cohere around sexuality and reproduction among adolescents, highlight the intersectionality of race, class, location, religion, ability and sexual orientation in health outcomes, and deconstruct normative frameworks and taken-for-granted assumptions. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.},

Nevertheless, socially marginalized women across the globe are currently facing threats to safe water access, which has dire implications for their health and that of their children. The City of Detroit, Michigan has recently shut off water services to over 50,000 residences, with low-income and racially marginalized women and their families disproportionately affected. The conditions for many Detroit residents are not unlike those in Monrovia, Liberia, where lack of access to safe water and substandard environments have contributed to the ongoing Ebola epidemic and subsequent maternal and infant mortality. Utilizing a comparative analytic approach rooted in postcolonial feminist theory and intersectionality, our commentary draws parallels between these two timely water, human rights, and reproductive justice crises in Detroit and Monrovia.

	abstract = {Purpose of review There is a growing clinical consensus that Medicaid sterilization consent protections should be revisited because they impede desired care for many women. Here, we consider the broad social and ideological contexts for past sterilization abuses, beyond informed consent. Recent findings Throughout the US history, the fertility and childbearing of poor women and women of color were not valued equally to those of affluent white women. This is evident in a range of practices and policies, including black women's treatment during slavery, removal of Native children to off-reservation boarding schools and coercive sterilizations of poor white women and women of color. Thus, reproductive experiences throughout the US history were stratified. This ideology of stratified reproduction persists today in social welfare programs, drug policy and programs promoting long-acting reversible contraception. Summary At their core, sterilization abuses reflected an ideology of stratified reproduction, in which some women's fertility was devalued compared to other women's fertility. Revisiting Medicaid sterilization regulations must therefore put issues of race, ethnicity, class, power and resources - not just informed consent - at the center of analyses. © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

	abstract = {Research on the U.S. women’s movement has documented the difficulties of cross-racial work between White women and women of racial/ethnic minorities. Less understood is how racial/ethnic minorities do cross-racial work among themselves to construct a collective identity of “women of color” that encourages solidarity across race, class, and other statuses. Drawing on research from the reproductive justice movement, I examine how women of color organizations that strive for intersectional praxis negotiate sameness and difference. I identify two different logics at work within women of color organizations: the first relies on a presumption of “same difference” that emphasizes similar experiences of gender and race oppression; the second accords greater recognition to the “difference-in-sameness” that structures constituents’ lived experiences. While the former can reproduce precisely those forms of silencing and exclusion that women of color organizations seek to challenge, the second remains a (necessarily) ongoing process. The article concludes that women of color organizations must strive continuously to actively negotiate, rather than assume, commonality if they are to avoid reproducing various forms of marginalization and inequality. © 2016, © 2016 by The Author(s).},

Its conclusion that “women’s rights are human rights” is a powerful claim in post-dictatorship politics where abortion is not yet legal and the full scope of women’s rights has yet to be included in the government’s human rights agenda. Argentine feminist human rights activists have long been attentive to the ways that social class, gender, migration, and racism intersect with reproduction. Because their government respects and responds to a human rights framework, however, they have not felt it necessary—as US feminists have—to invent a new notion of reproductive justice in order to be heard. Given the increasing popularity of reproductive justice in health and human rights, the Argentine case shows that rights-based claims can still be politically useful when a State values the concept of human rights. © 2015 Morgan.},

Enthusiasm for this approach stems from robust safety, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness data and responsiveness to women's needs and preferences. Although clinical evidence for immediate postpartum LARC is well-established, the ethical implications of enhancing access to this care have not been fully considered. Contraceptive policies and practices often embody a tension between fostering liberal availability and potentially coercive promotion of some methods. Historical contraceptive policies and contemporary disparities in LARC use point to the need to consider whether health policies and health care practices support all women's reproductive wishes. Immediate postpartum LARC services need to be designed and implemented with the goal of ensuring autonomy and equity in postpartum contraceptive care. To this end, these services should include strategic plans to promote universal availability, prevent coercion, and enable device removal. © 2017 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

First, participants expressed shock upon learning they or their partner was pregnant, followed by acceptance about their impending parenthood. Second, participants' views of abortion and adoption largely foreclosed these options as pathways by which to resolve their unintended pregnancies. Third, participants recounted numerous stories of the messages they received from parents, other family members and male partners that were frequently directive regarding how to resolve their pregnancies. These findings have implications for young people's reproductive health and rights, and for reproductive justice more broadly. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

Gurr paints an insightful portrait of the Indian Health Service (IHS)-the federal agency tasked with providing culturally appropriate, adequate healthcare to Native Americans-shedding much-needed light on Native American women's efforts to obtain prenatal care, access to contraception, abortion services, and access to care after sexual assault. Reproductive Justice goes beyond this local story to look more broadly at how race, gender, sex, sexuality, class, and nation inform the ways in which the government understands reproductive healthcare and organizes the delivery of this care. It reveals why the basic experience of reproductive healthcare for most Americans is so different-and better-than for Native American women in general, and women in reservation communities particularly. Finally, Gurr outlines the strengths that these communities can bring to the creation of their own reproductive justice, and considers the role of IHS in fostering these strengths as it moves forward in partnership with Native nations. Reproductive Justice offers a respectful and informed analysis of the stories Native American women have to tell about their bodies, their lives, and their communities. © 2015 by Catherine Gunther Kodat.

	abstract = {This book takes a reproductive justice approach to argue that surrogacy as practised in the contemporary neoliberal biomarkets crosses the humanitarian thresholds of feminism. Drawing on her ethnographic work with surrogate mothers, intended parents and medical practitioners in India, the author shows the dark connections between poverty, gender, human rights violations and indignity in the surrogacy market. In a developing country like India, bio-technologies therefore create reproductive objects of certain female bodies while promoting an image of reproductive liberation for others. India is a classic example for how far these biomarkets can exploit vulnerabilities for individual requirements in the garb of reproductive liberty. This critical book refers to a range of liberal, radical and postcolonial feminist frameworks on surrogacy, and questions the individual reproductive rights perspective as an approach to examine global surrogacy. It introduces ‘humanitarian feminism’ as an alternative concept to bridge feminist factions divided on contextual and ideological grounds. It hopes to build a global feminist solidarity drawing on a ‘reproductive justice’ approach by recognizing the histories of race, class, gender, sexuality, ability, age and immigration oppression in all communities. This work is of interest to researchers and students of medical sociology and anthropology, gender studies, bioethics, and development studies. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Little current research examines associations between infant mortality and US states' funding for family planning services and for abortion, despite growing efforts to restrict reproductive rights and services and documented associations between unintended pregnancy and infant mortality. Material and methods: We obtained publicly available data on state-only public funding for family planning and abortion services (years available: 1980, 1987, 1994, 2001, 2006, and 2010) and corresponding annual data on US county infant death rates. We modeled the funding as both fraction of state expenditures and per capita spending (per woman, age 15-44). State-level covariates comprised: Title X and Medicaid per capita funding, fertility rate, and percent of counties with no abortion services; county-level covariates were: median family income, and percent: black infants, adults without a high school education, urban, and female labor force participation. We used Possion log-linear models for: (1) repeat cross-sectional analyses, with random state and county effects; and (2) panel analysis, with fixed state effects. Results: Four findings were robust to analytic approach. First, since 2000, the rate ratio for infant death comparing states in the top funding quartile vs. no funding for abortion services ranged (in models including all covariates) between 0.94 and 0.98 (95% confidence intervals excluding 1, except for the 2001 cross-sectional analysis, whose upper bound equaled 1), yielding an average 15% reduction in risk (range: 8-22%). Second, a similar risk reduction for state per capita funding for family planning services occurred in 1994. Third, the excess risk associated with lower county income increased over time, and fourth, remained persistently high for counties with a high percent of black infants. Conclusions: Insofar as reducing infant mortality is a government priority, our data underscore the need, despite heightened contention, for adequate public funding for abortion services and for redressing health inequities. © 2016 The Authors.},

	abstract = {The last few decades have seen substantial progress in reducing preventable maternal mortality and expanding contraceptive use, yet tremendous suffering prevails worldwide due to the continued failure to realize greater reproductive justice, particularly for the world’s 1.9 billion women of childbearing age. The vision for reproductive rights has now expanded beyond enabling women and couples to have control over the number and spacing of their children, yet this remains an elusive goal for many. High rates of unintended pregnancy and deficiencies in maternity care are found in all settings, and unsafe abortions are widespread in many countries. Multiple socio-cultural and political sensitivities pose major challenges to improving reproductive health and well-being, as do the difficulties of operationalizing reproductive health programs. Overall, the burden of poor reproductive health is greatest in Africa, where poverty levels are highest, gender equity tends to be relatively low, and effective healthcare is less accessible or affordable. Harmful traditional practices such as child marriage are proving difficult to eradicate, especially where exacerbated by poverty and conflict, but intimate partner violence remains a common behavior in all regions. Everywhere, vulnerable groups include adolescents, poor women, and marginalized ethnic/racial and religious minorities. The achievement of universal access to maternal, sexual, and reproductive health services, an enhanced focus on equity, and improving quality of care are critical to fulfilling the human rights of women, improving development prospects, and alleviating suffering. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

While the United States and Western Europe may have been the vanguard of abortion law reform in the latter half of the twentieth century, Central and South America are proving to be laboratories of thought and innovation in the twenty-first century, as are particular countries in Africa and Asia. Abortion Law in Transnational Perspective offers a fresh look at significant transnational legal developments in recent years, examining key judicial decisions, constitutional texts, and regulatory reforms of abortion law in order to envision ways ahead. The chapters investigate issues of access, rights, and justice, as well as social constructions of women, sexuality, and pregnancy, through different legal procedures and regimes. They address the promises and risks of using legal procedure to achieve reproductive justice from different national, regional, and international vantage points; how public and courtroom debates are framed within medical, religious, and human rights arguments; the meaning of different narratives that recur in abortion litigation and language; and how respect for women and prenatal life is expressed in various legal regimes. By exploring how legal actors advocate, regulate, and adjudicate the issue of abortion, this timely volume seeks to build on existing developments to bring about change of a larger order. © 2014 University of Pennsylvania Press.

	abstract = {Intersectionality has been a capacious theoretical framework for understanding and enacting political praxis. Activists using an intersectional approach must cultivate flexibility and negotiate dynamics of difference and solidarity in relation to axes of power in local movement contexts. Recent scholarship on intersectional activisms raises questions about how intersectionality works in contemporary political struggles and whether there are particular strategies activists use to negotiate the dynamics of solidarity and difference in coalitions. This article contributes to the scholarship on intersectionality and political praxis through a case study of the Respect ABQ Women campaign against a municipal ballot initiative that would have banned abortions after twenty weeks in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I argue that constructing a campaign that shifted the narrative about abortion from pro-choice versus pro-life to one using a reproductive justice frame was key to defeating this ballot measure. Reproductive justice advocates used an innovative strengths-based, cross-sectoral approach that focused on mobilizing those who do not vote or who have reservations about abortion, especially Latino voters, and used storytelling as a methodology for communicating their electoral messages and engaging voters. My analysis is based on twelve interviews with participants in the Respect ABQ Women campaign and a review of campaign materials. The article concludes that the work by reproductive justice activists in the Respect ABQ Women campaign illustrates the praxis of intersectionality by engaging with those outside of traditional feminist politics and articulating the politics of place. © 2016 by The University of Chicago.

Drawing on multi-sited ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Rajasthan, Northwest India, we track two dynamic legal aid interventions on reproductive health rights in India, concerned with domestic violence and maternal mortality respectively, that have sought to fill this existing gap between ineffective state policies and the rhetoric on reproductive rights. Through an analysis of these interventions, we propose that requirements of reproductive justice cannot be met through discrete or private, albeit creative legal initiatives, pursued by individuals or civil society organisations but must involve comprehensive policies as well as strategies and alliances between state, non-state, transnational organisations and progressive political groups. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

The following month, however, Life Always put up billboards in Chicago displaying an image of President Barack Obama alongside the words: “Every 21 minutes, our next possible leader is aborted.”4. © Robin West, Justin Murray and Meredith Esser.},

	abstract = {Prefigurative politics are typically understood as experiments in living, laboring or provisioning that are alternatives to ‘what is’ and prefigure ‘what could be.’ This paper rethinks prefigurative politics, which scholars have often approached by emphasizing their economic and political structures, not the transformation of social relationships and power in these experiments. Despite this scholarly trend, many collectivities organizing around a politics of survival engage in prefigurative practices. In fact, in the process of resisting domination, they are re-imagining social relationships and power. In this paper, we draw on women of color feminist theory to explore the tensions of practicing principled politics and social justice in the deeply compromised spaces of struggle for those groups that act in the radical in-between of prefigurative politics and the politics of survival. By analyzing a reproductive justice organizing project called ‘We are BRAVE’ as a case study, we re-imagine prefigurative politics through three central elements: relationality, self-determination, and intersectionality. © 2016, PsychOpen.

Women seeking abortion are appropriate participants in clinical research requiring embryonic or foetal tissue, research with known risks to a foetus, and research designed to improve induced abortion methods. Critics of clinical research at the time of abortion are concerned that research opportunities will influence women’s abortion decisions, help women ‘rationalise’ their abortion, or exploit their vulnerability. I reject these arguments because they are largely based on stigma and negative stereotypes about women and abortion providers. However, economic and racial justice issues must be considered, since low-income women and women of colour disproportionately experience unintended pregnancy and abortion. I conclude that research regulations, and Institutional Review Board interpretations of them, should reflect knowledge gaps and reproductive justice values, rather than stigma, stereotypes and politics. Concerns about clinical research at the time of abortion must be considered alongside the potential harms of not doing such research. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

	abstract = {On February 1, 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ZIKV virus outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Pregnant women and their infants, are vulnerable to the impact of this vector-borne illness (mosquito) and sexually transmitted viral infection. The uncertainty surrounding the possibility of congenital anomalies due to ZIKV infection during pregnancy bring a renewed debate about the rights of women to control their reproductive decisions. Current strategies, resources and services aimed at prevention priorities fall short of responding to a clear framework regarding sexual reproductive health, rights and justice. A comprehensive approach to reproduction, in times of Zika, needs to empower women of reproductive age and their families to make decisions and to act on those decisions. This paper highlights the contributions of the Maternal-Infant Studies Center (CEMI-Spanish Acronym) in close collaboration with the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the University of the Puerto Rico School of Medicine and the University Hospital in providing comprehensive health care to pregnant women with ZIKV or at risk of ZIKV, at the very onset of the epidemic. CEMI approaches the care of pregnant women from a reproductive justice perspective, integrating clinical services, education, research, and advocacy. Transformación Prenatal (Centering Group Prenatal Care, GPC) currently implemented at the Puerto Rico University Hospital High Risk Clinics has been pivotal to achieve this aim. Based on the health professionals’ experiences and women’s testimonies, we articulate a set of principles and key actions that would benefit women, their family and children. © 2018, University of Puerto Rico.

	abstract = {Compensated surrogacy—an arrangement in which a woman carries and gives birth to a child for someone else in exchange for money—intimately affects women. Yet, feminist law reformers have not led efforts to regulate this practice in the United States. Their absence is notable given the significant influence of feminist lawmaking in a host of other areas where women’s interests are at stake. This lack of feminist law reform leadership can be understood, however, in light of the complex issues that surrogacy raises—complexity that has long divided feminists.In response to efforts to pass surrogacy legislation in Washington State in 2010, Legal Voice, a women’s rights organization founded in 1978, worked to develop a progressive, feminist approach to compensated surrogacy. The organization adopted a framework based primarily on two schools of feminist legal thought—an anti-essentialist analysis and a pragmatic approach—under the overarching goal of promoting reproductive justice. This Article proposes the application of these principles to the development of any surrogacy legislation. However, my primary purpose is to urge feminist law advocates to take leadership of surrogacy law reform. Whatever the feminist objections to the practice, people increasingly engage in surrogacy arrangements to create families and to help others to do so. But it is the women who hold the least power and face the highest risk of economic exploitation who bear the most significant risks in these arrangements. Thus, it is imperative that progressive feminists meet the challenge of addressing the complexity of compensated surrogacy, and develop a shared agenda for ensuring reproductive justice in the context of assisted reproductive technologies. © 2014, University of Washington School of Law.

Wade1 and its progeny continue to shift, from marital and medical privacy, 2 to women’s equality, 3 to individual liberty or dignity, 4 and back, in the minds of both the Supreme Court Justices and the pro-choice advocates and legal scholars that have argued or celebrated these famous cases. What has not shifted is the commitment of the pro-choice community to the right itself, and to the propriety of its judicial origin. Legal abortion, according to this near-universal pro-choice consensus, is and should be an individual, constitutional right protected against political winds, rather than simply good policy reflected in a state’s laws, and it is therefore entirely fitting that we look to the courts, and to the Supreme Court in particular, for its articulation and enforcement. It is the work of the courts and their actors-judges, lawyers, litigants, amici, judicial clerks, and academic commentators-to orate the basis of this important individual right, to develop its contours, and to expand or contract it when appropriate-to subject it in effect to the ordinary and extraordinary processes of constitutional adjudication. © Robin West, Justin Murray and Meredith Esser.},

	abstract = {In 2015, the birth rate among U.S. adolescents and young adults (aged 15–19 years) reached a historic low at 22.3 per 1,000 women. Despite positive trends, the United States continues to have the highest adolescent pregnancy rate among industrialized countries with data. Racial and ethnic disparities in adolescent pregnancy rates continue to exist, as do state-based differences in pregnancy, birth, and abortion rates. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists supports access for adolescents to all contraceptive methods approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In the absence of contraindications, patient choice should be the principal factor in prescribing one method of contraception over another. Dual method use—the use of condoms in combination with more effective contraceptive methods to protect against sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancy—is the ideal contraceptive practice for adolescents. Just as adolescents should have access to the full range of contraceptives, including long-acting reversible contraceptive methods, they should be able to decline and discontinue any method on their own, without barriers. A reproductive justice framework for contraceptive counseling and access is essential to providing equitable health care, accessing and having coverage for contraceptive methods, and resisting potential coercion by health care providers. Successful programs that resulted in measurable changes in adolescent contraceptive practices and sexual behavior have been described, but not implemented uniformly nor supported by policy improvements. More research is needed to determine which programs are most effective and which programs do not work. Continued efforts are integral to further advance positive trends. © by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.},

The five co-authors have worked together to examine the work of feminist disability scholarship with the goal of incorporating disability studies into our current intersectional approach to teaching. We begin with a brief introduction to feminist disability studies, paying particular attention to issues of identity and embodiment, and the ways in which disability, like gender, is socially constructed. We then share how the incorporation of a disability studies lens has influenced each of our courses, providing concrete examples. We examine the creation of new courses, such as the Sociology of Disability and Disability Studies in Education, which both explore disability through a gender, race, and class lens. Additionally, we discuss the integration of disability into existing courses, including an intersectional theory course, and a course on class, stratification, and power. Finally, we present an example of how disability studies perspectives can transform the teaching of a specific subject widely taught in gender-related courses—reproductive justice and the politics of choice. Bringing disability studies into the dialogue does not simply add to the curriculum and make it more inclusive, it also transforms it. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

	abstract = {Reproductive justice activists have dynamically used the concept of intersectionality as a source of empowerment to propel one of the most important shifts in reproductive politics in recent history. In the tradition of the Combahee River Collective, twelve Black women working within and outside the pro-choice movement in 1994 coined the term “reproductive justice” to “recognize the commonality of our experiences and, from the sharing and growing consciousness, to a politics that will change our lives and inevitably end our oppression.” Its popularity necessitates an examination of whether reproductive justice is sturdy enough to be analyzed as a novel critical feminist theory and a surprising success story of praxis through intersectionality. Offered to the intellectual commons of inquiry, reproductive justice has impressively built bridges between activists and the academy to stimulate thousands of scholarly articles, generate new women of color organizations, and prompt the reorganization of philanthropic foundations. This article defines reproductive justice, examines its use as an organizing and theoretical framework, and discusses Black patriarchal and feminist theoretical discourses through a reproductive justice lens. © 2017 University of Illinois at Chicago.},

Although sterilization is among the most straightforward surgical procedures an obstetrician–gynecologist performs, it is enormously complex when considered from a historical, sociological, or ethical perspective. Sterilization practices have embodied a problematic tension, in which some women who desired fertility were sterilized without their knowledge or consent, and other women who wanted sterilization to limit their family size lacked access to it. An ethical approach to the provision of sterilization must, therefore, promote access for women who wish to use sterilization as a method of contraception, but at the same time safeguard against coercive or otherwise unjust uses. This Committee Opinion reviews ethical issues related to the sterilization of women and outlines an approach to providing permanent sterilization within a reproductive justice framework that recognizes that all women have a right to pursue and to prevent pregnancy. © by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.},

Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat, New York, 2015a) is occurring in developing countries where about 40% of pregnancies are unplanned or unwanted (Sedgh et al., Stud Family Plan 45(3):301–314, 2014). These unintended pregnancies result in either unsafe abortions or births that are high risk and frequently cause the suffering of ill health or premature death. Reproductive health services that provide safe childbirth, modern contraception and safe abortion care are essential to avoiding and relieving suffering caused by risks to health. Reproductive justice also alleviates the detrimental effects of rapid population growth on the welfare of people and on life-supporting planetary ecosystems. Family planning protects and advances human rights and justice, and enhances personal, family and national economic development. In 2014 an estimated 225 million women in developing countries who wanted to avoid a pregnancy were not using an effective contraceptive method because they lacked information, access or face other barriers to using contraception (Singh et al. Adding it up: the costs and benefits of investing in sexual and reproductive health 2014. Guttmacher Institute and United Nations Population Fund, New York, 2014). Access to safe abortion services is even more constrained. To provide family planning to all women in developing countries who want to end or delay childbearing requires an increase from an estimated $4.1 billion from all sources to $9.4 billion annually (Singh et al. Adding it up: the costs and benefits of investing in sexual and reproductive health 2014. Guttmacher Institute and United Nations Population Fund, New York, 2014). With sufficient political will and devotion of adequate financial and other resources the high-fertility developing countries, such as those in Sub-Saharan Africa, could make the transition from high to low birth rates, slow their rapid population growth and achieve social and economic progress. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

Using a post-colonial feminist framework, we analyse South African and Zimbabwean women’s narratives regarding their abortion decision. As neighbouring countries, South Africa and Zimbabwe provide a useful counterpoint as they have common and differing social histories and very different abortion legislation. In our analysis, we unpick transversal commonalities and divergences in the discursive resources deployed by the women in their narratives in the two sites. Commonalities included the women feeling compelled to justify their abortion decision in the interactive interview space, an absence of a reproductive rights discourse, and the deployment of relationship embedded discourses in the justificatory work performed by the women. The “conjugalisation of reproduction”, “imperative of good mothering”, and “unstable partner relationships” discourses featured across both sites but the manner in which these were deployed differed. These discursive resources allowed the women to position themselves as making responsible decisions. The Zimbabwean women spoke of shame and hiding, a discursive resource that was explicitly absent in the South African women’s accounts. We conclude by arguing that our post-colonial feminist approach allows for a contextualised reproductive justice stance to abortion decision-making that identifies both transnational and context-specific power relations. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

Three underexplored areas of research into the embodied aspects of breastfeeding include lactation activism (lactivism), the dyadic (mother-child/children) body work of breastfeeding, and the efforts and beliefs of the professionals who support mothers as they initiate and continue to breastfeed.

After describing and evaluating British regulatory measures, I consider successive failures to control the assisted reproduction industry in the US. I discuss disparities between UK and US regulatory initiatives and their bearing on regulation in other countries. Then I turn to the political and social structures in which the assisted reproduction industry is embedded. I argue that regulatory bodies are seldom neutral arbiters. They tend to respond most readily to special interests and neglect strategies that could more effectively meet the health needs of the people they represent. Neither national nor international bodies have aggressively pursued policies to harness the industry, reduce infertility rates, or meet the needs of people whose fertility is threatened by substandard healthcare and environmental neglect. In conclusion, I consider recent initiatives by activist groups to mount an alternative response to the industry's current practices and build a transnational reproductive justice movement. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

The context for this case which originated in Selma, Alabama in 1966 illustrates that even if poor African American women had had access to contraception and legal abortion at that time, they would still have lacked reproductive autonomy and dignity as the state surveilled their sexual behavior and enforced laws making sex, itself, as well as reproduction, and the right to define their own intimate relationships and families, a race and class privilege. © 2010 Journal of Women's History.},

	abstract = {A quiet revolution has been taking place during the past three decades. The way that children enter families has changed radically among upper middle class families. In the 1980s infertility increasing became defined as a medical problem that could be solved with assisted reproductive technologies (ART) rather than through adoption. Asexual or ‘assisted conception’ involving medical technologies such as in vitro fertilization and embryo transfers began to replace sexual reproduction for infertile couples. Third parties, referred to as surrogates are hired to assist individuals and/or couples who wish to conceive and child with whom they share a genetic tie. This has resulted in a ‘surrogate baby boom’.; Outsourcing the Womb provides a critical introduction to the global surrogacy market. A comparative analysis of the assisted reproductive technology and surrogacy industry in Egypt, Israel, India and the United States disentangles the intersecting roles of race, religion, class inequality, religious law, and global capitalism. Gestational surrogacy challenges the idea of ‘natural’ reproduction and of the meaning of parenthood. What role should the state play in providing individuals and families with access to reproductive technologies? This book concludes with a discussion of ‘reproductive justice’.; The goal of this new, unique series is to offer readable, teachable "thinking frames" on today’s social problems and social issues by leading scholars, all in short 60 page or shorter formats, and available for view on http://routledge.customgateway.com/routledge-social-issues.html.; For instructors teaching a wide range of courses in the social sciences, the Routledge Social Issues Collection now offers the best of both worlds: originally written short texts that provide "overviews" to important social issues as well as teachable excerpts from larger works previously published by Routledge and other presses. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

Their right to have children is undermined as well by policies which curtail health care and welfare benefits. Abortion politics are also part of the battle over the separation of church and state. Religious conservatives try to blur the line by basing policy decisions on everything from emergency contraception to stem cell research on ideology and religion rather than science. The article also looks critically at the 'choice' framework for reproductive rights, and the intersection of abortion and population control politics. These two major fault lines have divided US feminists, weakening their ability to resist the right. Finally, the article shows how women of colour activists are promoting an expansive reproductive justice agenda which brings reproductive rights together with social justice and human rights. © 2006 Sage Publications.},

I review what is known about these women's reproductive health; identify three realms of reproduction oppression affecting their reproductive health: labor/occupational conditions, health care, and social relations involving race, immigration and fertility; and then highlight some current efforts at women farmworker-directed change. Finally, I make several analytical observations that suggest the importance of the reproductive justice framework to broader discussions of migrant worker justice and its role in realizing their right to health. © 2013 Galarneau.},

The collection includes contributions from leading scholars in law and public policy, medicine and public health, bioethics, anthropology, health geography, and economics. This timely and informative handbook looks at medical tourism from the perspective of some of the major regions that send and receive medical tourists, including the United States, the European Union, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. Contributors examine how government agencies, medical tourism companies, international hospital chains, and other organizations promote medical tourism and the globalization of health care. The topics explored include the legal remedies available to medical tourists when procedures go awry; potential consequences when patients cross borders for medical procedures that are illegal in their home countries; the relationship of medical tourism to international spread of infectious disease; and the lack of adequate transnational policies and regulations governing the global market for health services. © 2012 by Joan C.

When considering attitudes and beliefs that give rise to policies related to reproduction, it is critical to examine the ways in which the issues are framed. In this case-study-style analysis, the problematic ways in which the popular media frame issues related to reproductive justice are explored. In both popular music and television series, reproduction is framed in ways that limit reproductive justice for women. Women who actively choose to use birth control are portrayed negatively, misinformation about condoms and access to reproductive healthcare is perpetuated, and stereotypes about women and reproduction are reinforced. Based upon these analyses, it is recommended that further systematic content analyses be performed in addition to experimental work on the effects of media framing on support (or lack of support) for policies related to reproductive justice. It is also suggested that different types of media related to women's reproduction might be used to help young men and women develop skills for critically deconstructing and reframing messages about sex and reproduction put forth by various forms of media.},

Objectives: In this commentary, we review five indigenous communities in various stages of environmental health research and discuss the intersection of environmental health and reproductive justice issues in these communities as well as the limitations of legal recourse. Discussion: The health disparities impacting life expectancy and reproductive capabilities in indigenous communities are due to a combination of social, economic, and environmental factors. The system of federal environmental and Indian law is insufficient to protect indigenous communities from environmental contamination. Many communities are interested in developing appropriate research partnerships in order to discern the full impact of environmental contamination and prevent further damage. Conclusions: Continued research involving collaborative partnerships among scientific researchers, community members, and health care providers is needed to determine the impacts of this contamination and to develop approaches for remediation and policy interventions.},

This Essay discusses Professor Scales's concerns and feminist method and then turns to reproductive justice. The Essay notes that, with Scales, a right to abortion is foundational for reproductive justice. The Essay then examines the increasing narrowing of access to abortion through law. The Essay next examines a current crisis over access to contraception, including arguments that some contraceptives are abortifacients and therefore should not be available and the debate over insurance coverage for contraception under the Affordable Care Act. The Essay concludes with an examination of what reproductive justice advocates can do to stop what appears to be a steady undermining of rights to abortion and contraception, drawing in part on Professor Scales's concern with always examining women's voices and using political as well as litigation strategies.},

However, after a newer reproductive justice organization joined the coalition, material and organizing reflected a shift in framing to reproductive justice. How did this change happen? What are the impacts of this event for the women's movement? Through document analysis and interviews, I trace the negotiations that facilitated this framing shift. I argue that this new coalition frame translated into positive lasting changes in organizing for women's reproductive health even as the coalition dissolved and some of the tensions within the larger women's movement remain. © 2010 Alpha Kappa Delta.},

	abstract = {My project here is to argue for situating moral judgments about Indian surrogacy in the context of Reproductive Justice. I begin by crafting the best picture of Indian surrogacy available to me while marking some worries I have about discursive colonialism and epistemic honesty. Western feminists' responses to contract pregnancy fall loosely into two interrelated moments: post-Baby M discussions that focus on the morality of surrogacy work in Western contexts, and feminist biomedical ethnographies that focus on the lived dimensions of reproductive technologies and how they are embodied and negotiated in specific cultural contexts. Both approaches have their shortcomings. Uncritically extending Western moral frameworks (for example, liberal feminist political values) to Indian surrogacy work raises the specter of discursive colonialism; with it, worries arise about how Western normative traditions can distort, erase, or misread non-Western subjects' lived experiences. Feminist biomedical ethnographic approaches correct this, but raise the specter of a weak moral absenteeism; with it, concerns arise about under-theorizing the structural harms and injustices shaping surrogacy worker's lives. I suggest that we might reduce these shortcomings by framing normative and ethnographic engagement with global surrogacy as questions of reproductive justice. © by Hypatia, Inc.},

No matter its rationale, the constitutional right to abortion is fundamentally a negative right that rhetorically keeps the state out of the domain of family life. As such, the decision privatizes not only the abortion decision, but also parenting, by rendering the decision to carry a pregnancy to term a choice. It thereby legitimates a minimalist state response to the problems of pregnant women who carry their pregnancies to term and for poor parents who might need greater public support. These marginalized groups need greater community and state assistance with the demands of parenting, and the equation of reproductive justice with a right to terminate a pregnancy is in tension with a political or legal agenda for meeting those needs. The Essay then explores the possibility of creating a right to legal abortion through ordinary political means, rather than through constitutional adjudication, in such a way as not to carry these costs.},

This movement was attractive to many women of color who had rejected the collapse of a broader women's health movement into the abortion rights movement as too narrowly focused. Many women of color activists, including Ross, argued that the emphasis on abortion rights and choice failed to address the linked socioeconomic and community health issues confronted by many women of color and poor women. Ross's work spurred coalition building among white women and women of color that focused on expanding reproductive justice and women's health beyond legal abortion.

	abstract = {On the basis of a close reading of popular and medical texts which address a debate over the ethics of clinical drug trials funded by the United States and designed mainly for sub-Saharan Africa, I argue that international public health discourse about infant HIV infection in that region reflects and legitimates a neo-imperialist, anti-reproductive justice ideology. Participants share a fetal-centered logic that US-funded biomedicine must shoulder the burden of rescuing sub-Saharan Africa from itself by using the bodies of HIV-positive pregnant women to transmit biomedicine's magic bullet - antiretroviral drugs - to the next generation. The survival of the fetus, disguised as the well-being of the HIV-positive woman and accomplished by the magic of biomedical research, becomes the survival of a region otherwise doomed by its present state of economic, political, and medical incapacity. This version of what queer theorist Lee Edelman (2004, No Future: Queer Theory and the Death Drive) calls "reproductive futurism" redounds to the benefit of the more explicitly women-hating and nationalist ideologies of still-powerful right-wing movements against reproductive and sexual rights. © 2010 The Author.

Some conservative political and religious forces continue to resist implementation of several means of protecting and advancing reproductive rights. Individuals' rights to grant and to deny consent to medical procedures affecting their reproductive health and confidentiality have been progressively advanced. However, access to contraceptive services, while not necessarily opposed, is unjustifiably obstructed in some settings. Rights to lawful abortion have been considerably liberalized by legislative and judicial decisions, although resistance remains. Courts are increasingly requiring that lawful services be accommodated under transparent conditions of access and of legal protection. The conflict between rights of resort to lawful reproductive health services and to conscientious objection to participation is resolved by legal duties to refer patients to non-objecting providers. © 2009 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.},

Finally, I show how (perceived) co-optation leads to tensions between movement sectors and weakens the potential for reproductive justice to reinvigorate activism around reproductive issues. I conclude with how the success of the reproductive justice movement, including diversity and coalition building, can inform other social movements.

Using intersectionality for cross movement mobilization reveals that, contrary to criticism for being divisive, attention to intersecting identities has the potential to create solidarity and cohesion. In this article, we elaborate this argument with a case study of the intersection of race, gender, and disability in genetic technologies as well as in organizing to promote a social justice approach to the use of these technologies. We show how organizing based on an intersectional analysis can help forge alliances between reproductive justice, racial justice, women's rights, and disability rights activists to develop strategies to address reproductive genetic technologies. We use the work of Generations Ahead to illuminate how intersectionality applied at the movement-building level can identify genuine common ground, create authentic alliances, and more effectively advocate for shared policy priorities.

This coalitional politics articulates environmental and feminist concerns and rejects the limitations of a narrow-focused politics in favour of a more strategic, relational vision of social and environmental change. Framed by the Marxist-feminist concept of 'social reproduction', the analysis addresses the complex ways that globalised capitalism has transformed state and corporate responsibilities for social reproduction. The neoliberal policies of privatisation and deregulation have eroded the assurance of a liveable wage, affordable healthcare, decent education, breathable air, and clean water. Drawing on several examples from grassroots movements and community-based organisations, the essay discusses how diverse women activists conceptually link environmental justice and reproductive rights issues in their communities' struggles to sustain everyday life (or, to accomplish 'social reproduction'). The innovative coalition politics of organisations such as Asian Communities for Reproductive Justice and the Environmental Justice and Climate Change Coalition are generating dynamic 'living environmentalisms' with enough political vision and community 'groundedness' to build broadly-based social-environmental collaborations that stand a chance at compelling people to take stronger action to curb problems as big as global warming.},

The struggles within this novel, Stein maintains, for bio-and social diversity are deeply implicated in questions about patriarchal control of women's reproduction and sexuality. All Over Creation follows tensions between the captains of transnational corporations who seek the genetic control of potatoes and the food activists who resist biogenetic engineering. The conflict between these two, Ozeki shows, has important implications for reproductive justice, for matters of sexuality, and for diversity and free growth. Stein argues that the plot of All Over Creation describes compelling intersections between concerns of mainstream environmentalists and advocates for women's reproductive choice. ©Copyright by Foreign Literature Studies.

	abstract = {While rhetorical approaches are common in communication inquiry, metaphor's role in shaping our understanding of the intersection of environmental and social justice issues has not fully been explored. This essay seeks to address this deficit by examining Looking Both Ways: Women's Lives at the Crossroads of Reproductive Justice and Climate Justice, a publication of Asian Communities for Reproductive Justice. The text employs the metaphor of looking both ways to argue that climate and reproductive justice agenda setting should be aligned to simultaneously mitigate climate change and advance women's reproductive freedom. I contend looking both ways offers an innovative epistemological framework for articulating the intersections of climate and reproductive justice, as well as a convincing rationale for cultivating cross-movement coalitions. However, my analysis suggests that the organization's call to align climate and reproductive justice should be embraced with the acknowledgment that looking both ways limits a comprehensive coalitional perspective. This essay enhances current understandings of climate and reproductive justice concerns and demonstrates why diverse stakeholders committed to environmental causes must also support reproductive freedom. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {This article presents an overview of reproductive justice as a theoretical and activist paradigm developed in response to reproductive oppression in the United States, and focuses on the reproductive justice needs of Native American women, as well as the responses developed by Native American women and their allies to these needs. I make explicit the links between reproductive justice, environmental justice and human rights for Native American communities, and articulate the ways in which reproductive healthcare for Native American women as it is provided by the Indian Health Service (IHS) acts as a fulcrum for these links. Ultimately, the failure of the IHS to meet the reproductive healthcare needs of Native American women reflects the failure of the federal government to meet its obligations to Tribal nations; further, these failures produce structures of reproductive oppression in Native communities which scholars and activists seek to redress utilizing the rubric of women's reproductive health. © 2011 The Author.
